## Short Summary

AirBnB successfully migrated 3,500 React component test files from Enzyme to React Testing Library (RTL) using LLMs, reducing what was estimated to be an 18-month manual engineering effort to just 6 weeks. Through a combination of systematic automation, retry loops, and context-rich prompts, they achieved a 97% automated migration success rate, with the remaining 3% completed manually using the LLM-generated code as a baseline.

## Long Summary

This case study from AirBnB demonstrates a sophisticated application of LLMs in production for large-scale code migration, specifically transitioning from Enzyme to React Testing Library (RTL) for React component testing. The project showcases how LLMs can be effectively deployed to handle complex code transformation tasks that would traditionally require significant manual engineering effort.

The challenge AirBnB faced was significant: they needed to migrate nearly 3,500 React component test files while preserving both the original test intent and code coverage. The manual estimation for this work was approximately 1.5 years of engineering time. The company had adopted RTL in 2020 for new test development, but maintaining two testing frameworks wasn't sustainable, and simply deleting the old Enzyme tests would have created significant coverage gaps.

The LLMOps implementation was particularly noteworthy for its systematic and production-oriented approach. The team developed a robust pipeline that broke down the migration into discrete, parallelizable steps, treating it like a production system rather than a one-off transformation. Here's how they structured their approach:

First, they implemented a state machine model where each file moved through various validation and refactor stages. This allowed for precise tracking of progress and enabled parallel processing of hundreds of files simultaneously. The pipeline included multiple validation steps: Enzyme refactoring, Jest fixes, and lint/TypeScript compliance checks.

A key innovation in their approach was the implementation of configurable retry loops. Rather than trying to perfect the prompt engineering, they found that allowing multiple attempts with dynamic prompts was more effective. The system would feed validation errors and the most recent file version back to the LLM for each retry, allowing up to 10 attempts for most files.

The team's approach to context management was particularly sophisticated. They expanded their prompts to include between 40,000 to 100,000 tokens of context, incorporating:

• Source code of the component under test
• Related tests from the same directory
• Team-specific patterns
• General migration guidelines
• Common solutions
• Up to 50 related files
• Manually written few-shot examples
• Examples of existing, well-written passing test files
Their initial bulk run achieved a 75% success rate in just four hours, migrating approximately 2,625 files automatically. To handle the remaining files, they developed a systematic improvement process they called ""sample, tune, sweep"":

• Running remaining files to identify common failure patterns
• Selecting representative sample files
• Updating prompts and scripts
• Validating fixes against sample files
• Repeating the process with all remaining files
This iterative approach pushed their success rate to 97% over four days of refinement. For the final 3% of particularly complex files, they used the LLM-generated code as a starting point for manual completion.

From an LLMOps perspective, several aspects of their implementation stand out as best practices:

• The use of automated validation and verification steps
• Implementation of retry mechanisms with dynamic prompt updating
• Extensive context management and intelligent context selection
• Systematic tracking and improvement processes
• Parallel processing capabilities
• Fallback to human intervention for edge cases
The project also demonstrated impressive cost efficiency. Despite high retry counts for complex files, the total cost including LLM API usage and six weeks of engineering time was significantly lower than the estimated manual migration cost.

Some limitations and considerations from their approach should be noted. The system required significant upfront investment in automation infrastructure and prompt engineering. The approach also relied heavily on automated validation, which needed to be reliable to ensure the quality of the migrated code. Additionally, the high token count in prompts (up to 100,000 tokens) suggests they were using frontier models, which may have cost implications for smaller organizations.

This case study represents a mature example of LLMs in production, showing how they can be effectively integrated into software engineering workflows when combined with robust automation and validation systems. The success of this project has led AirBnB to consider expanding this approach to other code transformation tasks and exploring new applications of LLM-powered automation for developer productivity.

## Short Summary

LexMed developed an AI-native suite of tools leveraging large language models to streamline pain points for social security disability attorneys who advocate for claimants applying for disability benefits. The solution addresses the challenge of analyzing thousands of pages of medical records to find evidence that maps to complex regulatory requirements, as well as transcribing and auditing administrative hearings for procedural errors. By using LLMs with RAG architecture and custom logic, the platform automates the previously manual process of finding ""needles in haystacks"" within medical documentation and identifying regulatory compliance issues, enabling attorneys to provide more effective advocacy for all clients regardless of case complexity.

## Long Summary

## Company Overview and Problem Context

LexMed represents an AI-native legal technology company founded by a practicing social security disability attorney with 12 years of experience who previously handled 300 cases annually. The company addresses critical inefficiencies in the social security disability legal process, where attorneys must navigate a complex bureaucratic system to help claimants establish their inability to work for at least 12 consecutive months due to severe impairments.

The fundamental challenge lies in the nature of social security disability law, where approximately 85% of initial applications are denied, requiring extensive documentation and evidence gathering. Attorneys must analyze thousands of pages of medical records to find specific clinical findings that map to regulatory requirements, while also preparing cases for potential appeals through a four-stage process. The founder describes this as finding ""needles in haystacks"" within massive document collections, a problem that became the catalyst for developing AI-powered solutions.

## Technical Architecture and LLM Implementation

The core technical approach centers on leveraging large language models to automate the previously manual process of document analysis and regulatory mapping. Prior to LLMs, the founder used Adobe plugins and named entity recognition techniques to create word repositories that could match clinical findings to regulatory requirements. However, these traditional approaches were limited by their inability to handle synonyms and varied medical terminology effectively.

The breakthrough came with OpenAI's release in November 2022, which enabled the sophisticated natural language understanding needed for medical document analysis. The system employs what the founder describes as ""mega prompts"" that incorporate the sequential logic and conditional decision trees inherent in social security disability regulations. This approach allows the LLM to distinguish between different medical terms that describe the same clinical finding, such as the various ways to describe ""reduced range of motion"" in medical records.

## RAG Implementation for Regulatory Compliance

LexMed's platform utilizes Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture to maintain a dynamic database of regulatory frameworks spanning hundreds of pages. This system matches clinical findings from medical records against the ""ground truth"" of regulatory requirements, such as the specific criteria for listing 1.04 (degenerative disc disease with nerve root compression). The RAG implementation allows the system to adapt as regulations change, which is critical given that requirements have been modified to make qualification more difficult over time.

The regulatory mapping process involves complex multi-factor analysis where claimants must meet multiple specific criteria within a 12-month period. For example, establishing disability under listing 1.04 requires diagnostic imaging showing nerve compression, physical examination evidence of limited range of motion, sensory and reflex loss, muscle weakness, and positive straight leg raise tests. The LLM system can piece together these requirements from evidence scattered across thousands of pages of medical records from multiple healthcare visits.

Beyond document analysis, LexMed has developed a sophisticated transcription service for administrative hearings that goes beyond standard automatic speech recognition. The system incorporates domain-specific knowledge to correctly interpret legal and medical terminology that generic transcription services often mishandle. Using ground truth data from actual hearing audio paired with human transcripts, the platform employs regular expressions and pattern matching to improve accuracy for specialized vocabulary.

The transcription pipeline includes speaker labeling functionality that identifies different participants in hearings, including judges, attorneys, claimants, and expert witnesses. This structured approach enables downstream analysis capabilities that can audit hearing proceedings for procedural errors and regulatory violations.

## Automated Hearing Auditing with Function Calling

One of the most sophisticated applications involves using LLMs to audit vocational expert testimony during administrative hearings. The system employs function calling through MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers to access SQL databases containing job information and cross-reference expert testimony against current labor market realities. This approach identifies instances where vocational experts cite outdated or non-existent jobs as potential employment options for disabled claimants.

The auditing logic incorporates the founder's expertise in identifying common errors, such as when experts suggest jobs that require physical capabilities incompatible with a claimant's documented limitations. For instance, if someone cannot bend at the waist more than occasionally due to back impairment, the system flags testimony suggesting jobs requiring frequent stooping. This automated analysis provides attorneys with ""cheat sheets"" highlighting potential grounds for appeal without requiring hours of manual review.

## Production Deployment and Scalability Considerations

The platform addresses critical production considerations for legal technology, including security requirements for handling protected health information and confidential legal documents. The founder acknowledges the significant technical and financial investments required to properly implement security measures for medical data processing, which influenced their decision to launch with transcription services while developing the more complex document analysis capabilities.

The business model reflects the economics of disability law practice, where attorneys work on contingency rather than hourly billing. This creates pressure to maximize efficiency across large caseloads, making automation particularly valuable. The system is designed to eliminate the need for attorneys to make difficult triage decisions about which cases receive thorough analysis based on perceived likelihood of success.

## Integration with Legal Workflow

The LLM-powered tools integrate into existing legal workflows by providing automated analysis that previously required extensive manual effort. Rather than replacing attorney judgment, the system acts as what the founder calls ""the great equalizer,"" enabling all attorneys to provide the level of detailed case analysis that was previously only feasible for specialists with particular expertise in audit procedures.

The platform generates actionable insights that attorneys can use immediately, such as identifying specific regulatory violations or missing evidence requirements. This approach addresses the reality that many attorneys skip detailed hearing analysis due to time constraints, missing opportunities for appeals that could benefit their clients.

## Ethical Considerations and Access to Justice

The founder frames the technology implementation in terms of democratizing justice and ensuring equal representation for all claimants regardless of case complexity. The ethical framework emphasizes using AI to enhance rather than replace human advocacy, with the goal of preventing situations where resource constraints force attorneys to provide unequal representation to different clients.

This perspective on AI as an equalizing force contrasts with concerns about technology displacing legal professionals. Instead, the implementation focuses on enabling more thorough and consistent advocacy across all cases, potentially improving outcomes for vulnerable populations navigating complex government systems.

## Technical Challenges and Lessons Learned

The development process revealed several key technical challenges specific to legal AI implementation. Medical terminology presents particular difficulties due to the multiple ways identical clinical findings can be described across different healthcare systems and documentation standards. The LLM's ability to handle synonyms and contextual variations proved crucial for effective implementation.

The regulatory framework's complexity requires sophisticated prompt engineering to capture the sequential logic and conditional decision trees inherent in disability determination processes. The founder's domain expertise was essential for translating legal logic into effective LLM prompts, suggesting that successful legal AI implementations require deep collaboration between technical and subject matter experts.

## Future Development and Expansion Plans

LexMed is expanding its capabilities with chart vision technology for processing medical imaging and diagnostic reports, representing a natural evolution from text-based analysis to multi-modal document processing. The company is pursuing strategic partnerships with law firms and fundraising to scale operations, indicating a transition from founder-led development to broader market deployment.

The roadmap includes enhancing the automated analysis capabilities and expanding the regulatory database to cover additional areas of disability law. The platform's modular architecture appears designed to accommodate these expansions while maintaining the core functionality that addresses attorneys' most pressing efficiency challenges.

## Short Summary

Apollo Tyres developed a Manufacturing Reasoner powered by Amazon Bedrock Agents to automate root cause analysis for their tire curing processes. The solution replaced manual analysis that took 7 hours per issue with an AI-powered system that delivers insights in under 10 minutes, achieving an 88% reduction in manual effort. The multi-agent system analyzes real-time IoT data from over 250 automated curing presses to identify bottlenecks across 25+ subelements, enabling data-driven decision-making and targeting annual savings of approximately 15 million Indian rupees in their passenger car radial division.

## Long Summary

## Company Overview and Business Context

Apollo Tyres is a prominent international tire manufacturer headquartered in Gurgaon, India, with production facilities across India and Europe. The company operates under two global brands - Apollo and Vredestein - and distributes products in over 100 countries through an extensive network of outlets. Their product portfolio spans the complete spectrum of tire manufacturing, including passenger car, SUV, truck-bus, two-wheeler, agriculture, industrial, and specialty tires.

As part of an ambitious digital transformation initiative, Apollo Tyres collaborated with Amazon Web Services to implement a centralized data lake architecture. The company's strategic focus centers on streamlining their entire business value process, with particular emphasis on manufacturing optimization. This digital transformation journey led to the development of their Manufacturing Reasoner solution, which represents a sophisticated application of generative AI in industrial settings.

## Problem Statement and Business Challenge

The core challenge faced by Apollo Tyres centered on the manual and time-intensive process of analyzing dry cycle time (DCT) for their highly automated curing presses. Plant engineers were required to conduct extensive manual analysis to identify bottlenecks and focus areas using industrial IoT descriptive dashboards. This analysis needed to cover millions of parameters across multiple dimensions including all machines, stock-keeping units (SKUs), cure mediums, suppliers, machine types, subelements, and sub-subelements.

The existing process presented several critical limitations. First, the analysis consumed between 7 hours per issue on average, with some cases requiring up to 2 elapsed hours per issue for initial assessment. Second, subelement-level analysis - particularly bottleneck analysis of subelement and sub-subelement activities - was not feasible using traditional root cause analysis tools. Third, the process required coordination between subject matter experts from various departments including manufacturing, technology, and industrial engineering. Finally, since insights were not generated in real-time, corrective actions were consistently delayed, impacting operational efficiency.

## Technical Architecture and LLMOps Implementation

The Manufacturing Reasoner solution represents a sophisticated multi-agent architecture built on Amazon Bedrock. The system demonstrates advanced LLMOps practices through its comprehensive agent orchestration, real-time data processing, and natural language interface capabilities.

### Multi-Agent Architecture Design

The solution employs a primary AI agent that serves as the orchestration layer, classifying question complexity and routing requests to specialized agents. This primary agent coordinates with several specialized agents, each designed for specific analytical functions. The complex transformation engine agent functions as an on-demand transformation engine for context and specific questions. The root cause analysis agent constructs multistep, multi-LLM workflows to perform detailed automated RCA, particularly valuable for complex diagnostic scenarios.

The system also includes an explainer agent that uses Anthropic's Claude Haiku model to generate two-part explanations: evidence providing step-by-step logical explanations of executed queries, and conclusions offering brief answers referencing Amazon Redshift records. A visualization agent generates Plotly chart code for creating visual charts using Anthropic's Claude Sonnet model. This multi-agent approach demonstrates sophisticated LLMOps practices in agent coordination and specialization.

### Data Integration and Real-Time Processing

The technical infrastructure connects curing machine data flows to AWS Cloud through industrial Internet of Things (IoT) integration. Machines continuously transmit real-time sensor data, process information, operational metrics, events, and condition monitoring data to the cloud infrastructure. This real-time data streaming capability is essential for the solution's effectiveness in providing immediate insights and enabling rapid corrective actions.

The system leverages Amazon Redshift as its primary data warehouse, providing reliable access to actionable data for the AI agents. Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases integration with Amazon OpenSearch Service vector database capabilities enables efficient context extraction for incoming requests. This architecture demonstrates mature LLMOps practices in data pipeline management and real-time processing.

### Natural Language Interface and User Experience

The user interface is implemented as a Chainlit application hosted on Amazon EC2, enabling plant engineers to interact with the system using natural language queries in English. This interface represents a significant advancement in manufacturing analytics, allowing domain experts to access complex industrial IoT data without requiring technical expertise in query languages or data manipulation.

The system processes user questions through the primary AI agent, which classifies complexity and routes requests appropriately. The primary agent calls explainer and visualization agents concurrently using multiple threads, demonstrating efficient parallel processing capabilities. Results are streamed back to the application, which dynamically displays statistical plots and formats records in tables, providing comprehensive visual and textual insights.

## Performance Optimization and LLMOps Best Practices

The development team encountered and addressed several critical performance challenges that highlight important LLMOps considerations for production deployments. Initially, the solution faced significant response time delays when using Amazon Bedrock, particularly with multiple agent involvement. Response times exceeded 1 minute for data retrieval and processing across all three agents, which was unacceptable for operational use.

Through systematic optimization efforts, the team reduced response times to approximately 30-40 seconds by carefully selecting appropriate large language models and small language models, and disabling unused workflows within agents. This optimization process demonstrates the importance of model selection and workflow efficiency in production LLMOps environments.

The team also addressed challenges related to LLM-generated code for data visualization. Initially, generated code often contained inaccuracies or failed to handle large datasets correctly. Through continuous refinement and iterative development, they developed a dynamic approach capable of accurately generating chart code for efficiently managing data within data frames, regardless of record volume. This iterative improvement process exemplifies mature LLMOps practices in code generation and validation.

### Data Quality and Consistency Management

Consistency issues were resolved by ensuring correct data format ingestion into the Amazon data lake for the knowledge base. The team established a structured format including questions in natural language, complex transformation engine scripts, and associated metadata. This structured approach to data preparation demonstrates important LLMOps practices in data quality management and knowledge base maintenance.

## Governance and Safety Implementation

The solution implements Amazon Bedrock Guardrails to establish tailored filters and response limits, ensuring that interactions with machine data remain secure, relevant, and compliant with operational guidelines. These guardrails prevent errors and inaccuracies by automatically verifying information validity, which is essential for accurate root cause identification in manufacturing environments.

This governance approach demonstrates mature LLMOps practices in production safety and compliance management. The guardrails help maintain system reliability while enabling natural language interaction with sensitive operational data.

## Operational Impact and Business Results

The Manufacturing Reasoner solution delivers significant operational improvements across multiple dimensions. The system analyzes data from over 250 automated curing presses, more than 140 SKUs, three types of curing mediums, and two types of machine suppliers across 25+ automated subelements. This comprehensive coverage enables detailed bottleneck identification and targeted improvement recommendations.

The solution achieved an 88% reduction in manual effort for root cause analysis, reducing analysis time from up to 7 hours per issue to less than 10 minutes per issue. This dramatic improvement enables plant engineers to focus on implementing corrective actions rather than data analysis. The system provides real-time triggers to highlight continuous anomalous shifts in DCT for mistake-proofing and error prevention, aligning with Poka-yoke methodologies.

Additional benefits include observability of elemental-wise cycle time with graphs and statistical process control charts, press-to-press direct comparison on real-time streaming data, and on-demand RCA capabilities with daily alerts to manufacturing subject matter experts. The targeted annual savings of approximately 15 million Indian rupees in the passenger car radial division alone demonstrates substantial business value from the LLMOps implementation.

## Lessons Learned and LLMOps Best Practices

The Apollo Tyres implementation provides several valuable insights for LLMOps practitioners working with industrial IoT and real-time data. The team learned that applying generative AI to streaming real-time industrial IoT data requires extensive research due to the unique nature of each use case. The journey from prototype to proof-of-concept involved exploring multiple strategies to develop an effective manufacturing reasoner for automated RCA scenarios.

Performance optimization emerged as a critical consideration, requiring careful model selection and workflow optimization to achieve acceptable response times. The iterative approach to improving code generation capabilities demonstrates the importance of continuous refinement in production LLMOps environments.

Data quality and consistency management proved essential for reliable system operation. The structured approach to knowledge base preparation and maintenance ensures consistent system performance and accurate insights.

## Future Scaling and Development Plans

The Apollo Tyres team is scaling the successful solution from tire curing to various areas across different locations, advancing toward Industry 5.0 goals. Amazon Bedrock will play a pivotal role in extending the multi-agentic Retrieval Augmented Generation solution through specialized agents with distinct roles for specific functionalities.

The team continues focusing on benchmarking and optimizing response times for queries, streamlining decision-making and problem-solving capabilities across the extended solution. Apollo Tyres is also exploring additional generative AI applications using Amazon Bedrock for other manufacturing and non-manufacturing processes.

This expansion strategy demonstrates mature LLMOps thinking in scaling successful solutions across broader organizational contexts while maintaining performance and reliability standards. The focus on specialized agents for different domains shows sophisticated understanding of multi-agent system design and deployment strategies.

The Manufacturing Reasoner case study represents a comprehensive example of production LLMOps implementation in industrial settings, demonstrating successful integration of multiple AI agents, real-time data processing, natural language interfaces, and robust governance frameworks to deliver substantial business value through manufacturing optimization.

## Short Summary

Tabs, a vertical AI company in the finance space, has built a revenue intelligence platform for B2B companies that uses ambient AI agents to automate financial workflows. The company extracts information from sales contracts to create a ""commercial graph"" and deploys AI agents that work autonomously in the background to handle billing, collections, and reporting tasks. Their approach moves beyond traditional guided AI experiences toward fully ambient agents that monitor communications and trigger actions automatically, with the goal of creating ""beautiful operational software that no one ever has to go into.""

## Long Summary

## Company Overview and Use Case

Tabs is a vertical AI company founded in December 2022 by CEO Ali and CTO Deepo, who previously worked together at Latch, a smart access company in New York City. The company focuses specifically on revenue intelligence for B2B sellers, addressing what they identify as the last major area of innovation in general ledger management after payroll and expense management have been largely solved.

The core problem Tabs addresses is that most B2B companies operate with very lean revenue teams - typically a $50 million revenue B2B company might have just one VP of finance and perhaps an offshore billing specialist. Tabs aims to help these companies ""get the most money into your bank account as quickly as possible"" while enabling accurate reporting against revenue operations.

## Technical Architecture and Data Model

The foundation of Tabs' LLMOps implementation is what they call the ""commercial graph"" - a knowledge graph that captures all possible information about merchant-customer relationships. This concept parallels other vertical graph approaches like Rippling's ""employee graph"" or Ramp's ""vendor graph,"" but focuses specifically on commercial relationships in B2B sales contexts.

The platform begins by taking sales contracts from a sales-led motion and extracting all key information to run revenue operations. While document information extraction was initially a core differentiator, the founders recognized early that this would become commoditized and focused instead on building intelligent workflows on top of the extracted data.

The commercial graph is hydrated with diverse data sources including:

• Contract terms and modifications
• Customer communication history and sentiment analysis
• Usage data and behavioral patterns
• Payment history and collection patterns
• Customer support interactions
## LLMOps Evolution: From Guided to Ambient AI

Tabs' LLMOps journey illustrates a clear evolution in AI implementation strategies. The company started with traditional software engineering for the first year and a half, then layered on what they call ""guided AI experiences"" - essentially co-pilot functionality where the AI provides insights but operators remain responsible for completing tasks.

However, their current focus is on ""leapfrogging"" the guided experience phase to move directly into fully agentic experiences. This represents a more proactive approach where agents either execute tasks autonomously or request permission to act, rather than simply providing recommendations.

The company has deliberately avoided implementing a chat interface for their agentic experiences, instead focusing entirely on ambient functionality. This design decision reflects their belief that the future lies in agents that operate in the background without requiring explicit human prompting for each action.

## Ambient Agent Implementation

Tabs' ambient agents represent a sophisticated implementation of background AI workers that monitor communication channels and trigger actions based on events rather than explicit commands. For example, their agents monitor email communications between the company and its customers, automatically processing relevant information and initiating appropriate responses or workflows.

The agents are designed to integrate seamlessly with existing communication modes, particularly Slack and email. When an agent needs human approval, it sends draft communications through these channels just as a human team member would. For instance, when responding to customer emails, an agent might send a Slack message saying ""we received this email, this is what we'd like to send out, does it look okay?"" - mimicking natural human collaboration patterns.

This approach addresses what the team identifies as a fundamental shift from background agents (which require human initiation) to truly ambient agents (which are triggered by events). The key distinction is that ambient agents listen continuously to communication streams and organizational processes, acting autonomously when appropriate triggers occur.

## Technical Challenges and LLMOps Considerations

The primary technical challenge Tabs faces is information retrieval and relevance determination within their knowledge graph. As Deepo explains, ""you can hydrate your knowledge graph as much as you want but it's really about knowing what is the most important stuff to pull."" This challenge becomes particularly acute in enterprise B2B contexts where vast amounts of unstructured data exist across multiple dimensions.

The company struggles with determining what information is relevant to specific tasks, particularly when dealing with customer behaviors, sentiment analysis, usage patterns, contract modifications, and communication history. They've identified that every vertical AI company will eventually face this information retrieval problem as their knowledge graphs become more comprehensive.

Memory and learning represent another significant challenge. The agents need to remember previous interactions and decisions to avoid repeatedly asking for the same approvals or making the same mistakes. However, rather than implementing traditional memory systems, Tabs is exploring approaches that feed learned information back into the commercial graph, making it available for future retrieval.

## User Experience and Interface Design

Tabs has made deliberate design choices about how humans interact with their ambient agents. They've rejected traditional UI patterns in favor of integration with existing communication tools. The audit trail and task management happen through what they're building as an ""agent inbox"" - essentially bringing developer workflow concepts like Kanban boards and ticket systems into the finance domain.

This reflects their broader philosophy of bringing ""developer processes to other areas of an organization,"" including concepts like running sprints and using prioritization systems for financial operations. For example, they might prioritize between a 10,000 invoice that might get paid versus a 100 invoice that will definitely get paid with outreach.

However, their vision extends beyond prioritization to true parallelization - having ""endless number of parallel threads"" that can handle all tasks simultaneously, with gates only at points of ambiguity or dependency (such as month-end close processes where certain tasks must complete before others can begin).

## Industry-Specific Considerations

The finance industry presents unique challenges for LLMOps implementation. As Deepo notes, ""when the numbers are wrong they [accountants and finance people] are left to blame,"" which creates high demands for explainability and audit trails. This has influenced their interface design to include explicit approval mechanisms where users can ""click a button and they can say oh like yes or no like explicitly.""

The company believes that memory and learned behaviors will become a significant moat for enterprise applications, as ""every enterprise that we work with has a different way in which they do business and being able to do it on an enterprise by enterprise basis is important."" This suggests that successful LLMOps in finance requires not just technical sophistication but deep customization to organizational patterns.

## Future Vision and Technical Roadmap

Tabs envisions an end state of ""beautiful operational software that no one ever has to go into"" - essentially creating a fully ambient system where agents handle tactical operations while humans focus on strategic work. Their target organization structure includes a lean internal finance team (CFO, VP of finance) supported by multiple agents running ambiently in the background.

The technical roadmap involves two main phases: first, hydrating their commercial graph with comprehensive data even if some proves irrelevant, and second, solving the information retrieval problem to ensure agents get the right context for their tasks. They're also exploring how to implement effective memory systems by feeding learned behaviors back into the graph structure.

This case study illustrates the evolution of LLMOps from simple document processing to sophisticated ambient agent systems that integrate deeply with organizational workflows and communication patterns. While still early in implementation, Tabs' approach demonstrates how vertical AI companies can build defensible moats through domain-specific knowledge graphs and learned organizational behaviors.

https://portkey.ai/blog/transforming-e-commerce-search-with-generative-ai-insights-from-walmarts-journey/

## Short Summary

Walmart implemented semantic caching to enhance their e-commerce search functionality, moving beyond traditional exact-match caching to understand query intent and meaning. The system achieved unexpectedly high cache hit rates of around 50% for tail queries (compared to anticipated 10-20%), while handling the challenges of latency and cost optimization in a production environment. The solution enables more relevant product recommendations and improves the overall customer search experience.

## Long Summary

This case study examines Walmart's implementation of semantic caching and generative AI technologies to revolutionize their e-commerce search capabilities. Under the leadership of Chief Software Architect Rohit Chatter, Walmart has developed and deployed an innovative approach to handling search queries that goes beyond traditional caching mechanisms, demonstrating a practical application of LLMs in a high-scale production environment.

The core challenge Walmart faced was the limitation of traditional caching systems in e-commerce search. Conventional caches rely on exact matches, which fail to capture the nuanced ways customers express their search intentions. This limitation is particularly evident in handling tail queries - less common search terms that collectively make up a significant portion of search traffic.

## Technical Implementation and Architecture

Walmart's semantic caching implementation represents a sophisticated approach to production LLM deployment. The system works by understanding the semantic meaning behind search queries rather than just matching exact strings. This is achieved through several key technical components:

• Vector Embeddings: The system converts both product SKUs and search queries into vector representations that capture semantic meaning
• Hybrid Caching Architecture: The implementation combines both traditional and semantic caching approaches to optimize for different types of queries
• Vector Search Infrastructure: A scalable system for performing similarity searches across vector representations
The semantic cache implementation presents several technical challenges that Walmart had to address:

• Compute Intensity: Semantic caching requires significantly more computational resources than traditional caching, as it needs to process and compare vector embeddings
• Storage Requirements: Vector representations of products and queries require substantially more storage space
• Response Time Optimization: The team works towards achieving sub-second response times while maintaining result quality
• Cost Management: Balancing the expenses of vector storage and computation against the benefits of improved search results
## Production Results and Metrics

The results of the implementation have been notably positive:

• Cache Hit Rates: Achieved approximately 50% cache hit rates for tail queries, significantly exceeding initial expectations of 10-20%
• Query Understanding: Successfully handles complex, context-dependent queries like ""football watch party"" by understanding the broader context and returning relevant product groupings
• Zero-Result Reduction: The system has shown significant improvement in reducing zero-result searches
## Real-World Application Examples

The system demonstrates its effectiveness through practical use cases. For instance, when a customer searches for ""football watch party,"" the semantic understanding allows the system to return a comprehensive set of relevant items:

• Party snacks and chips
• Beverages
• Super Bowl apparel
• Televisions and viewing equipment
This showcases the system's ability to understand not just the literal search terms but the broader context and intent behind the search.

## Engineering Challenges and Solutions

The implementation team faced several significant engineering challenges:

• Latency Management: Semantic caching introduces additional computational overhead compared to traditional caching, requiring careful optimization
• Cost-Performance Balance: The team needed to balance the improved search quality against increased computational and storage costs
• Scale Considerations: Implementing the system at Walmart's massive scale required careful architecture decisions
To address these challenges, Walmart adopted a hybrid approach:

• Dual-Cache Strategy: Using both traditional and semantic caching in parallel
• Optimized Vector Operations: Implementing efficient vector search and comparison mechanisms
• Careful Resource Allocation: Balancing where and when to apply semantic caching versus traditional approaches
## Architectural Decisions and Trade-offs

The team made several key architectural decisions:

• Vector Database Selection: Choosing appropriate storage solutions for vector embeddings
• Caching Strategy: Implementing a hybrid approach that combines traditional and semantic caching
• Query Processing Pipeline: Designing an efficient flow for converting queries to vectors and performing searches
## Future Directions

Walmart's vision for the future of this technology includes:

• Integration with AR/VR Technologies: Plans to combine semantic search with immersive shopping experiences
• Expanded Use Cases: Applying semantic understanding to other aspects of the e-commerce experience
• Performance Optimization: Continuing work on reducing latency while maintaining quality
## Lessons Learned and Best Practices

https://blog.duolingo.com/scaling-duoradio/

## Short Summary

Duolingo tackled the challenge of scaling their DuoRadio feature, a podcast-like audio learning experience, by implementing an AI-driven content generation pipeline. They transformed a labor-intensive manual process into an automated system using LLMs for script generation and evaluation, coupled with Text-to-Speech technology. This allowed them to expand from 300 to 15,000+ episodes across 25+ language courses in under six months, while reducing costs by 99% and growing daily active users from 100K to 5.5M.

## Long Summary

Duolingo's implementation of LLMs to scale their DuoRadio feature represents a comprehensive case study in applying generative AI to solve content generation challenges in education technology. The case study demonstrates how a thoughtful, iterative approach to LLMOps can transform a manual, resource-intensive process into an efficient, automated system while maintaining high quality standards.

The initial challenge faced by Duolingo was significant: their DuoRadio feature, which provided podcast-like audio content for language learning, required extensive manual effort for script creation, voice acting, and audio editing. This manual process limited their ability to scale, with just 300 episodes taking nearly a year to produce.

Their journey to automation involved several key technical approaches and learnings in LLMOps:

Initial Experimentation and Failures:

• Their first attempt at using LLMs to generate scripts from scratch produced low-quality content requiring extensive manual editing
• A second attempt at using LLMs for automated translations of existing English content also failed due to accuracy and proficiency level issues
• These early failures highlighted the importance of proper prompt engineering and the need for domain-specific context
Breakthrough Approach:
Instead of relying on complex constraint-based prompts, they discovered that feeding existing curriculum content into their LLM yielded better results. This approach provided the model with specific patterns to follow, resulting in more appropriate and accurate content generation. This insight demonstrates the importance of high-quality training data and context in LLM applications.

The Production Pipeline:
Duolingo developed a sophisticated end-to-end content generation pipeline with several key components:

Curriculum-Driven Generation:

• They leveraged language-specific content from their existing curriculum to improve the accuracy and relevance of generated scripts
• This approach proved particularly important for non-English language courses where English-only prompts were less effective
Quality Control System:

• They implemented a multi-stage filtering process using LLMs to evaluate generated content
• The evaluation criteria included naturalness, grammaticality, coherence, and logic
• They generated excess content and filtered down to only the highest quality material
• Learning Designers continuously refined the evaluator prompts to improve quality standards
Audio Production Automation:

• Advanced Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology was integrated for automated voiceover generation
• They implemented audio hashing techniques for consistent audio elements like intros and outros
• This reduced manual editing time significantly while maintaining quality
Technical Infrastructure:

• They developed ""Workflow Builder,"" an internal content generation prototyping tool
• The system was designed to run without human intervention post-initiation
• The pipeline integrated script generation, evaluation, audio production, and deployment
Results and Metrics:
The implementation of this LLMOps pipeline delivered impressive results:

• Scaled from 2 to 25+ courses
• Increased from 300 to 15,000+ episodes
• Grew daily active users from 100K to 5.5M
• Achieved 99% cost reduction
• Completed in less than 6 months what would have taken 5+ years manually
Key LLMOps Lessons:
The case study highlights several important principles for successful LLM implementation in production:

• The importance of starting with high-quality, domain-specific data rather than relying on complex prompt engineering
• The value of building robust evaluation systems to maintain quality at scale
• The benefit of standardizing certain aspects (like exercise placement) to make automation more reliable
• The need for continuous refinement of prompts and evaluation criteria
• The importance of end-to-end automation while maintaining quality control checkpoints
Particularly noteworthy is their approach to quality assurance, which involved overproducing content and then using LLMs themselves to filter for quality, rather than trying to perfect the generation process itself. This approach acknowledges the probabilistic nature of LLM outputs and builds that understanding into the system design.

The case study also demonstrates the importance of having domain experts (Learning Designers) involved in the process of refining and improving the LLM systems over time. Rather than treating the LLM as a black box, they continuously improved the prompts and evaluation criteria based on expert feedback and learner data.

Future Directions:
Duolingo plans to expand this approach to other forms of longform content, suggesting that the pipeline they've built is flexible enough to be adapted to different content types while maintaining quality standards. This scalability and adaptability is a crucial aspect of successful LLMOps implementations.

## Long Summary

## Climate Tech Foundation Models Case Study Overview

This case study examines how climate technology startups are building specialized foundation models to address environmental challenges using Amazon SageMaker HyperPod as their primary MLOps infrastructure. The case covers multiple companies including Orbital Materials and Hum.AI, representing a new wave of climate tech companies that have moved beyond traditional LLM fine-tuning to develop custom foundation models trained from scratch on environmental datasets.

The climate tech sector has evolved through distinct phases of AI adoption. Initially in early 2023, companies focused on operational optimization using existing LLMs through Amazon Bedrock and fine-tuning on AWS Trainium. The second wave involved building intelligent assistants by fine-tuning models like Llama 7B for specific use cases. The current third wave represents companies building entirely new foundation models specifically designed for environmental applications, processing real-world data rather than text-based datasets.

## Technical Implementation and Architecture

### Orbital Materials: Diffusion Models for Material Discovery

Orbital Materials has developed a proprietary AI platform called ""Orb"" that uses generative AI to design, synthesize, and test new sustainable materials. Their approach replaces traditional trial-and-error laboratory methods with AI-driven design processes. The company built Orb as a diffusion model trained from scratch using SageMaker HyperPod, focusing initially on developing sorbents for carbon capture in direct air capture facilities.

The technical achievement is significant - since establishing their laboratory in Q1 2024, Orbital achieved a tenfold improvement in material performance using their AI platform, representing an order of magnitude faster development than traditional approaches. This improvement directly impacts the economics of carbon removal by driving down costs and enabling rapid scale-up of carbon capture technologies.

From an LLMOps perspective, Orbital Materials chose SageMaker HyperPod for its integrated management capabilities, describing it as a ""one-stop shop for control and monitoring."" The platform's deep health checks for stress testing GPU instances allowed them to reduce total cost of ownership by automatically swapping out faulty nodes. The automatic node replacement and training restart from checkpoints freed up significant engineering time that would otherwise be spent managing infrastructure failures.

The SageMaker HyperPod monitoring agent provides comprehensive oversight, continually detecting memory exhaustion, disk failures, GPU anomalies, kernel deadlocks, container runtime issues, and out-of-memory crashes. Based on the specific issue detected, the system either replaces or reboots nodes automatically, ensuring training continuity without manual intervention.

With the launch of SageMaker HyperPod on Amazon EKS, Orbital established a unified control plane managing both CPU-based workloads and GPU-accelerated tasks within a single Kubernetes cluster. This architectural approach eliminates the complexity of managing separate clusters for different compute resources, significantly reducing operational overhead. The integration with Amazon CloudWatch Container Insights provides enhanced observability, collecting and aggregating metrics and logs from containerized applications with detailed performance insights down to the container level.

### Hum.AI: Hybrid Architecture for Earth Observation

Hum.AI represents another compelling example of climate tech foundation model development, building generative AI models that provide intelligence about the natural world. Their platform enables tracking and prediction of ecosystems and biodiversity, with applications including coastal ecosystem restoration and biodiversity protection. The company works with coastal communities to restore ecosystems and improve biodiversity outcomes.

The technical architecture employed by Hum.AI is particularly sophisticated, utilizing a variational autoencoder (VAE) and generative adversarial network (GAN) hybrid design specifically optimized for satellite imagery analysis. This encoder-decoder model transforms satellite data into a learned latent space while the decoder reconstructs imagery after processing, maintaining consistency across different satellite sources. The discriminator network provides both adversarial training signals and feature-wise reconstruction metrics.

This architectural approach preserves important ecosystem details that would typically be lost with traditional pixel-based comparisons, particularly for underwater environments where water reflections interfere with visibility. The company achieved a breakthrough capability to see underwater from space for the first time, overcoming historical challenges posed by water reflections.

Hum.AI trains their models on 50 years of historic satellite data, amounting to thousands of petabytes of information. Processing this massive dataset required the scalable infrastructure provided by SageMaker HyperPod. The distributed training approach simultaneously optimizes both VAE and GAN objectives across multiple GPUs, paired with the auto-resume feature that automatically restarts training from the latest checkpoint, providing continuity even through node failures.

The company leveraged comprehensive observability features through Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus and Amazon Managed Service for Grafana for metric tracking. Their distributed training monitoring included dashboards for cluster performance, GPU metrics, network traffic, and storage operations. This extensive monitoring infrastructure enabled optimization of training processes and maintained high resource utilization throughout model development.

## LLMOps Infrastructure and Operational Excellence

### SageMaker HyperPod Capabilities

The case study demonstrates several critical LLMOps capabilities that SageMaker HyperPod provides for foundation model development. The platform removes undifferentiated heavy lifting for climate tech startups, enabling them to focus on model development rather than infrastructure management. The service provides deep infrastructure control optimized for processing complex environmental data, featuring secure access to Amazon EC2 instances and seamless integration with orchestration tools including Slurm and Amazon EKS.

The intelligent resource management capabilities prove particularly valuable for climate modeling applications, automatically governing task priorities and resource allocation while reducing operational overhead by up to 40%. This efficiency is crucial for climate tech startups processing vast environmental datasets, as the system maintains progress through checkpointing while ensuring critical climate modeling workloads receive necessary resources.

The platform includes a library of over 30 curated model training recipes that accelerate development, allowing teams to begin training environmental models in minutes rather than weeks. Integration with Amazon EKS provides robust fault tolerance and high availability, essential for maintaining continuous environmental monitoring and analysis.

### Distributed Training and Fault Tolerance

Both companies highlighted the critical importance of fault tolerance in their foundation model training. Hum.AI's CEO Kelly Zheng emphasized that SageMaker HyperPod ""was the only service out there where you can continue training through failure."" The ability to train larger models faster through large-scale clusters and redundancy offered significant advantages over alternative approaches.

The automatic hot-swapping of GPUs when failures occur saves thousands of dollars in lost progress between checkpoints.

## Short Summary

INRIX partnered with AWS to develop an AI-powered solution that accelerates transportation planning by combining their 50 petabyte data lake with Amazon Bedrock's generative AI capabilities. The solution addresses the challenge of processing vast amounts of transportation data to identify high-risk locations for vulnerable road users and automatically generate safety countermeasures. By leveraging Amazon Nova Canvas for image visualization and RAG-powered natural language queries, the system transforms traditional manual processes that took weeks into automated workflows that can be completed in days, enabling faster deployment of safety measures while maintaining compliance with local regulations.

## Long Summary

## Company and Use Case Overview

INRIX is a transportation intelligence company that has pioneered the use of GPS data from connected vehicles for over 20 years. The company operates a massive 50 petabyte data lake containing real-time and historical transportation data collected from connected cars, mobile devices, roadway sensors, and event monitoring systems. INRIX serves automotive, enterprise, and public sector use cases, ranging from financial services datasets to digital twins for major cities like Philadelphia and San Francisco.

In June 2024, the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) selected INRIX for a proof of concept to develop a generative AI-powered solution aimed at improving safety for vulnerable road users (VRUs). The core challenge was to harness the combination of Caltrans' asset, crash, and points-of-interest data with INRIX's extensive data lake to anticipate high-risk locations and rapidly generate empirically validated safety measures to mitigate potential crashes.

## Technical Architecture and LLMOps Implementation

The solution, built around INRIX's Compass platform announced in November 2023, demonstrates a sophisticated LLMOps architecture leveraging AWS services. The system employs a multi-component approach with distinct phases for countermeasure generation and image visualization.

### Countermeasures Generation Pipeline

The countermeasure generation component utilizes Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases integrated with Anthropic's Claude models to implement Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). This setup enables the system to process natural language queries such as ""Where are the top five locations with the highest risk for vulnerable road users?"" and ""Can you recommend a suite of proven safety countermeasures at each of these locations?"" The RAG implementation allows users to probe deeper into roadway characteristics that contribute to risk factors and identify similar locations in the roadway network that meet specific conditions.

The system architecture includes Amazon API Gateway and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) for managing API requests and responses. This serverless architecture approach demonstrates scalable LLMOps practices, allowing the system to handle varying loads while maintaining performance consistency. The use of Kubernetes for container orchestration suggests a focus on operational reliability and deployment automation.

Behind the scenes, the Compass AI system uses foundation models to query the roadway network, identifying and prioritizing locations with systemic risk factors and anomalous safety patterns. The solution provides prioritized recommendations for operational and design solutions based on industry knowledge, demonstrating how LLMs can be effectively applied to domain-specific expertise.

### Image Visualization and Generation

The image visualization component represents an innovative application of generative AI in transportation planning. Traditionally, the process of creating conceptual drawings for transportation countermeasures involved multiple specialized teams including transportation engineers, urban planners, landscape architects, CAD specialists, safety analysts, public works departments, and traffic operations teams. This collaborative process typically extended timelines significantly due to multiple rounds of reviews, adjustments, and approvals.

INRIX's solution addresses this challenge by implementing Amazon Nova Canvas for image generation and in-painting capabilities. The system uses AWS Lambda for processing requests and Amazon Bedrock with Nova Canvas to provide sophisticated image editing operations. The implementation supports text-to-image generation and image-to-image transformation, enabling rapid iteration of conceptual drawings.

### In-Painting and Few-Shot Learning Implementation

The in-painting functionality enables object replacement through two distinct approaches: binary mask-based replacement for precise area targeting, and text prompt-based identification for more flexible object modification. This demonstrates advanced prompt engineering techniques adapted for visual content generation.

The system incorporates few-shot learning approaches with reference images and carefully crafted prompts, allowing seamless integration of city-specific requirements into generated outputs. This approach addresses the challenge of maintaining compliance with local standards while accelerating the design process. The few-shot learning implementation suggests sophisticated prompt engineering practices that enable the system to adapt to different municipal requirements without extensive retraining.

## Production Deployment and Operational Considerations

The solution follows a two-stage process for visualizing transportation countermeasures in production. Initially, the system employs image generation functionality to create street-view representations corresponding to specific longitude and latitude coordinates where interventions are proposed. Following the initial image creation, the in-painting capability enables precise placement of countermeasures within the generated street view scene.

The Amazon Bedrock API facilitates image editing and generation through the Nova Canvas model, with responses containing generated or modified images in base64 format. This approach demonstrates practical considerations for handling large binary data in production LLMOps systems. The base64 encoding approach suggests attention to data transfer efficiency and integration with existing workflows.

## Scalability and Performance Considerations

The serverless architecture approach using API Gateway and Lambda demonstrates scalable LLMOps practices. The combination of Amazon EKS for the main application infrastructure and Lambda for specific processing tasks suggests a hybrid approach that balances performance requirements with operational efficiency.

The RAG implementation can be extended to incorporate county-specific regulations, standardized design patterns, and contextual requirements. This extensibility demonstrates how LLMOps systems can be designed to accommodate evolving requirements without fundamental architectural changes.

## Safety and Responsible AI Implementation

Amazon Nova Canvas incorporates built-in safety measures, including watermarking and content moderation systems, addressing responsible AI implementation concerns. This demonstrates awareness of potential misuse and the importance of maintaining content integrity in production systems.

The comprehensive range of image editing operations supported by the system includes basic image generation, object removal, object replacement, creation of image variations, and background modification. This versatility makes the solution suitable for various professional applications requiring sophisticated image editing while maintaining safety standards.

## Operational Impact and Efficiency Gains

The integration of generative AI capabilities enables rapid iteration and simultaneous visualization of multiple countermeasures within a single image. Traditional manual visualization processes that previously required extensive time and resources can now be executed efficiently through automated generation and modification. The solution delivers substantial improvements in both time-to-deployment and cost-effectiveness, potentially reducing design cycles from weeks to days.

## Technical Challenges and Considerations

While the case study presents significant achievements, certain technical challenges warrant consideration. The reliance on large foundation models introduces latency and cost considerations that must be managed in production environments. The quality and consistency of generated visualizations depend heavily on prompt engineering and the underlying training data of the foundation models.

The system's effectiveness in handling edge cases and unusual scenarios may require ongoing refinement and validation. The integration of multiple AWS services introduces complexity in monitoring, debugging, and maintaining system reliability across the entire pipeline.

## Future Extensibility and Integration

The modular architecture suggests potential for future enhancements and integrations. The RAG implementation provides a foundation for incorporating additional data sources and domain expertise. The image generation capabilities could be extended to support additional visualization formats and interactive elements.

The system's design appears to support integration with existing transportation planning workflows and tools, suggesting practical deployment considerations were addressed during development. The ability to handle city-specific requirements through few-shot learning indicates adaptability to diverse operational environments.

This case study demonstrates a sophisticated application of LLMOps principles in addressing complex real-world challenges in transportation planning and safety. The combination of large-scale data processing, natural language understanding, and automated visualization represents a comprehensive approach to leveraging AI in production environments while maintaining focus on practical outcomes and operational efficiency.

## Short Summary

Formula 1 developed an AI-driven root cause analysis assistant using Amazon Bedrock to streamline issue resolution during race events. The solution reduced troubleshooting time from weeks to minutes by enabling engineers to query system issues using natural language, automatically checking system health, and providing remediation recommendations. The implementation combines ETL pipelines, RAG, and agentic capabilities to process logs and interact with internal systems, resulting in an 86% reduction in end-to-end resolution time.

## Long Summary

Formula 1's implementation of an AI-powered root cause analysis system represents a significant advancement in using LLMs for production operations support. This case study demonstrates how generative AI can be effectively deployed to solve complex operational challenges in high-stakes, time-critical environments.

The problem Formula 1 faced was significant: during live race events, IT engineers needed to quickly triage critical issues across various services, including network degradation affecting their APIs and downstream services like F1 TV. The traditional approach to resolving these issues could take up to three weeks, involving multiple teams and extensive manual investigation. A specific example highlighted in the case study showed that a recurring web API system issue required around 15 full engineer days to resolve through iterative analysis across multiple events.

The solution architecture implemented by Formula 1 demonstrates several key aspects of modern LLMOps:

Data Processing and ETL Pipeline:

## Short Summary

The research analyzes real-world prompt templates from open-source LLM-powered applications to understand their structure, composition, and effectiveness. Through analysis of over 2,000 prompt templates from production applications like those from Uber and Microsoft, the study identifies key components, patterns, and best practices for template design. The findings reveal that well-structured templates with specific patterns can significantly improve LLMs' instruction-following abilities, potentially enabling weaker models to achieve performance comparable to more advanced ones.

## Long Summary

This comprehensive study examines how prompt templates are designed and used in production LLM applications, analyzing real-world implementations from major companies and open-source projects. The research is particularly valuable as it bridges the gap between academic prompt engineering research and practical production deployment of LLMs.

The researchers analyzed a dataset of 2,163 distinct prompt templates extracted from production LLM applications, including significant examples from companies like Uber (a tool for refactoring code related to feature flag APIs used by over 200 developers) and Microsoft (a code-first agent framework with over 5k GitHub stars). The study's methodology combined automated analysis using LLMs with human verification to ensure accuracy.

Key findings about production prompt template design and implementation include:

• Component Structure
The analysis revealed seven main components in production prompt templates:

• Profile/Role (28.4% of templates)
• Directive (86.7%)
• Workflow (27.5%)
• Context (56.2%)
• Examples (19.9%)
• Output Format/Style (39.7%)
• Constraints (35.7%)
The research identified that many production systems follow a common sequential order in their templates, typically starting with Profile/Role and Directive components. This standardization helps maintain consistency across different use cases and makes templates more maintainable.

• JSON Output Patterns
An important finding for production systems was the prevalence of JSON as an output format. The study identified three main patterns in how JSON outputs are specified:

• Basic JSON indication (36.21% of templates)
• JSON with explicit attribute names (19.83%)
• Fully specified JSON with attribute descriptions (43.97%)
The research found that more detailed JSON specifications led to better performance and more consistent outputs, which is crucial for production systems that need to process LLM outputs programmatically.

• Placeholder Usage
The study identified four main types of placeholders used in production templates:

• User Question (24.5% of templates)
• Contextual Information (19.5%)
• Knowledge Input (50.9%)
• Metadata/Short Phrases (43.4%)
A significant finding was that Knowledge Input placeholders perform better when positioned after the task instructions, particularly for longer inputs. This has important implications for RAG systems and other production applications that need to process variable-length inputs.

The research also provides valuable insights into practical LLMOps considerations:

• Cost Optimization
The study found that well-designed prompt templates can enable weaker (and cheaper) models to achieve performance comparable to more expensive models. This has significant implications for production cost optimization, suggesting that companies might be able to use less expensive models with better-designed templates rather than immediately upgrading to more powerful models.

• Template Maintenance
The research emphasizes the importance of clear naming conventions and documentation for placeholders in production systems. Many templates (about 5%) used overly generic names like ""text"" which can complicate maintenance and evolution of the system.

• Error Reduction
The analysis found that using explicit constraints and output format specifications significantly reduced errors in production systems. For example, templates using explicit JSON attribute descriptions showed better format adherence and reduced the need for output parsing error handling.

• In-Context Learning Trade-offs
An interesting finding for production systems was that fewer than 20% of applications used few-shot examples in their templates, contrary to common academic recommendations. The research suggests that well-defined templates often perform better without examples, while also reducing token usage and associated costs.

The study provides several practical recommendations for LLMOps implementations:

• Pre-defined Templates: LLM providers should offer pre-defined templates for common tasks, following the identified optimal patterns
• Automated Evaluation Tools: Development of tools to help evaluate and refine prompt templates based on the identified metrics
• Template Maintenance: Regular review and updating of templates based on usage data and performance metrics
• Cost Optimization: Consider template optimization before upgrading to more expensive models
The research also highlights several challenges in production LLM systems:

• Balancing template complexity with maintenance requirements
• Managing trade-offs between token usage and template effectiveness
• Ensuring consistent output formats while handling variable inputs
• Maintaining template performance across different model versions
This work provides valuable insights for organizations implementing LLMs in production, offering evidence-based guidance for template design and maintenance while considering practical constraints like cost and maintainability.

## Short Summary

GEICO explored using LLMs for customer service chatbots through a hackathon initiative in 2023. After discovering issues with hallucinations and ""overpromising"" in their initial implementation, they developed a comprehensive RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) solution enhanced with their novel ""RagRails"" approach. This method successfully reduced incorrect responses from 12 out of 20 to zero in test cases by providing structured guidance within retrieved context, demonstrating how to safely deploy LLMs in a regulated insurance environment.

## Long Summary

This case study details GEICO's journey in implementing Large Language Models (LLMs) for customer service applications, providing valuable insights into the challenges and solutions for deploying LLMs in a regulated insurance environment.

The initiative began with a 2023 hackathon where teams explored potential LLM applications. One winning proposal focused on creating a conversational interface to replace traditional web forms, allowing dynamic question-asking based on conversation state and data model requirements. However, early testing revealed significant challenges with both commercial and open-source LLMs, particularly regarding response reliability and accuracy.

### Technical Implementation and Challenges

The team identified hallucinations as a major concern, particularly a specific type they termed ""overpromising"" where the LLM would incorrectly assume capabilities it didn't have. Rather than pursuing expensive fine-tuning approaches, they opted for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) as their primary solution due to its cost-effectiveness, flexibility, transparency, and efficiency.

Their RAG implementation involved several key technical components:

• A pipeline for converting business knowledge into vector representations
• An asynchronous offline conversion process to maintain high QPS (Queries Per Second)
• Implementation of Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) graphs for efficient vector search
• A two-step retrieval process using LLM-translated user inputs
• Strategic positioning of retrieved knowledge within the context window
The team developed a sophisticated data processing pipeline that included:

• Document splitting
• Embedding generation through API calls
• Metadata extraction using LLMs
• Vector database indexing with metadata support
### Innovation: The RagRails Approach

One of the most significant innovations was the development of ""RagRails,"" a novel approach to guide LLM responses. This came after observing that even with identical inputs, the LLM would produce varying responses with a consistent percentage being incorrect. Initial testing showed that 12 out of 20 responses contained errors in certain scenarios.

The RagRails strategy involves:

• Adding specific guiding instructions within retrieved records
• Maintaining context relevance while reinforcing desired behaviors
• Implementing systematic testing for consistency
• Focusing on repeatability in positive outcomes
This approach proved highly effective, reducing error rates from 60% to 0% in their test cases.

### Production Considerations and Optimizations

The team implemented several optimization strategies for production deployment:

• Relevance checking mechanisms to filter retrieved context
• Ranking mechanisms to prioritize most relevant information
• Strategic positioning of context within the LLM's attention window
• Balancing between response quality and computational cost
They also recognized the need for cost management in production, suggesting the use of smaller, specialized models for specific tasks like:

• Optimization
• Entity extraction
• Relevance detection

## Long Summary

IntellectAI, a business unit of Intellect Design Arena, has developed an innovative approach to scaling ESG compliance analysis through their Purple Fabric platform. This case study demonstrates a sophisticated implementation of LLMs in production, particularly focusing on the challenges and solutions in deploying RAG systems at scale for financial analysis.

The core challenge addressed was the transformation of manual ESG compliance analysis, which previously relied on subject matter experts who could only examine 100-150 companies, into an automated system capable of processing data from over 8,000 companies. This represents a significant achievement in operationalizing AI for real-world financial decision-making, where the stakes are exceptionally high given the client's $1.5 trillion portfolio spread across 9,000 companies.

Technical Implementation and Architecture:

The Purple Fabric platform's architecture is built on several key components:

• MongoDB Atlas as the primary database infrastructure
• Atlas Vector Search for efficient vector similarity operations
• A unified data model that handles both structured and unstructured data
• Multimodal processing capabilities for text and image data
• Time series collections for temporal analysis
The system's technical achievements include:

• Processing of 10 million documents across 30+ different data formats
• Integration of hundreds of millions of vectors
• Handling of multiple languages
• Achievement of over 90% accuracy in compliance assessments
• Real-time processing capabilities
• 1000x speed improvement over manual analysis
What makes this implementation particularly noteworthy from an LLMOps perspective is how it addresses several critical challenges in deploying LLMs in production:

The platform's ability to process diverse data formats and types demonstrates robust data engineering practices essential for production LLM systems.

Accuracy and Reliability:
The achievement of 90%+ accuracy is particularly significant given the financial stakes involved. This level of accuracy exceeds typical RAG implementations (which usually achieve 80-85%) and was accomplished through careful system design and optimization. The platform includes mechanisms for contextual understanding rather than simple search, indicating sophisticated prompt engineering and retrieval strategies.

Scalability and Performance:
The system's ability to scale from handling 150 companies to 8,000 companies while maintaining performance demonstrates effective implementation of distributed computing and database optimization. The use of MongoDB's time series collections and vector search capabilities shows how different database technologies can be integrated to support LLM operations at scale.

• Developer-friendly architecture maintaining simplicity despite complex operations
• Robust schema flexibility for handling evolving data types
• Enterprise-grade support and monitoring capabilities
Lessons and Best Practices:

Several key lessons emerge from this implementation:

• The importance of choosing a unified data model rather than separate systems for different data types
• The value of building flexible systems that can accommodate future data types and modalities
• The need for balancing accuracy with scale in production LLM systems
• The importance of maintaining simplicity in architecture despite complex requirements
Future Considerations:

The platform is designed with future expansion in mind, particularly:

• Integration of additional data modalities (audio, video)
• Increased processing capabilities for larger datasets
• Enhanced accuracy through continued system optimization
• Expansion into new use cases beyond ESG compliance
Critical Analysis:

While the case study presents impressive results, it's important to note some considerations:

• The 90% accuracy claim would benefit from more detailed explanation of measurement methodology
• The specific techniques used to exceed typical RAG accuracy aren't fully detailed
• The balance between processing speed and accuracy maintenance could be further explored
This case study represents a sophisticated example of LLMs being deployed in a production environment where accuracy and scale are equally critical. The implementation demonstrates how careful attention to data architecture, processing pipeline design, and scalability considerations can result in a system that significantly outperforms manual processes while maintaining high accuracy standards.

## Short Summary

Vouch Insurance implemented a production machine learning system using Metaflow to handle risk classification and document processing for their technology-focused insurance business. The system combines traditional data warehousing with LLM-powered predictions, processing structured and unstructured data through hourly pipelines. They built a comprehensive stack that includes data transformation, LLM integration via OpenAI, and a FastAPI service layer with an SDK for easy integration by product engineers.

## Long Summary

Vouch Insurance, a company specializing in providing business insurance for technology companies and startups, has implemented a sophisticated LLMOps infrastructure to address two primary challenges: risk classification for underwriting and processing document-intensive insurance workflows. This case study presents an interesting example of combining traditional data infrastructure with modern LLM capabilities in a production environment.

## System Architecture and Infrastructure

The company built their LLM pipeline system on top of a modern data stack, with several key components working together:

• Data Layer: The foundation includes DBT and Snowflake for data warehousing, along with PostgreSQL databases for operational data
• Orchestration: Metaflow serves as the central orchestration tool, managing both data transformations and LLM interactions
• LLM Integration: OpenAI's APIs are accessed through LangChain for making predictions
• API Layer: FastAPI serves as the interface for serving predictions
• Client Integration: A custom SDK allows product engineers to easily integrate with the system
The team started with the AWS Batch Terraform template provided by Metaflow and extended it with additional security features, including AWS Cognito integration for authentication through Gmail. This demonstrates a practical approach to securing LLM systems in production while maintaining usability.

## Pipeline Implementation

The system operates through several stages:

The system runs on two main cadences:

• Risk classification pipelines execute hourly, checking for new data that needs processing
• Document AI workflows run on-demand as new documents enter the system
## Scale and Technical Considerations

The system operates at a moderate scale, handling terabytes of data across structured, semi-structured, numeric, and text formats, with a particular focus on PDF document processing. This scale allows them to manage costs and performance without requiring extreme optimization strategies.

Some key technical decisions and learnings include:

• Development Environment: To handle cross-platform development challenges (especially with Mac AMD issues), the team containerized Metaflow using Docker
• Cost Management: The system implements checks to avoid redundant LLM calls by verifying existing predictions before making new API calls
• SDK Development: To simplify integration, they created an SDK that allows product engineers to access predictions with minimal code
## Challenges and Lessons Learned

The team encountered several challenges and arrived at practical solutions:

• Local Development: Cross-platform development issues led to containerization, though this introduced its own complexities
• Event-Driven Architecture: While the initial batch-based approach worked, they identified a need for more comprehensive event-driven pipeline examples and implementations
• Pipeline Optimization: The hourly cadence of their main pipelines provided a natural rate-limiting mechanism, helping manage API costs and system load
## Infrastructure Security and Access Management

The team put significant thought into securing their infrastructure:

• Authentication: Implementation of AWS Cognito for user authentication
• Access Control: Integration with Gmail for user sign-in
• Load Balancer Security: Security measures at the Application Load Balancer (ALB) level
## Developer Experience

The system caters to two distinct user personas:

## Future Considerations

The team has identified several areas for potential improvement:

• Moving towards more event-driven architectures
• Expanding their container-based development approach
• Further optimization of LLM interaction patterns
The case study demonstrates a practical approach to implementing LLMs in production, showing how traditional data infrastructure can be effectively combined with modern LLM capabilities. The team's focus on developer experience and practical solutions to common challenges provides valuable insights for others implementing similar systems.

## Short Summary

Thomson Reuters evolved their AI assistant strategy from helpfulness-focused tools to productive agentic systems that make judgments and produce output in high-stakes legal, tax, and compliance environments. They developed a framework treating agency as adjustable dials (autonomy, context, memory, coordination) rather than binary states, enabling them to decompose legacy applications into tools that AI agents can leverage.

## Long Summary

## Thomson Reuters: Building Production-Ready Agentic AI for Legal and Tax Workflows

Thomson Reuters represents a compelling case study in enterprise LLMOps, showcasing how a century-old company with deep domain expertise successfully evolved their AI strategy from simple assistants to sophisticated agentic systems. As a company serving 97% of top 100 US law firms and 99% of Fortune 100 companies, Thomson Reuters operates in environments where accuracy and reliability are paramount, making their approach to production LLM deployment particularly instructive.

### Strategic Evolution: From Helpfulness to Productivity

The company's journey began approximately 2.5 years ago with the development of AI assistants focused on being ""helpful"" - providing accurate information with proper citations. However, they identified a fundamental shift in user expectations and business requirements, moving from assistants that merely help to systems that actively produce output and make decisions on behalf of users. This evolution is particularly significant in legal, tax, and compliance domains where the cost of errors can be substantial.

This strategic pivot reflects a broader industry trend toward what they term ""agentic AI"" - systems that don't just respond to queries but actively execute complex workflows, make judgments, and produce actionable outputs. The Y Combinator quote they reference - ""don't build agentic tools for law firms, build law firms of agents"" - encapsulates this transformation from tool-assisted work to agent-performed work.

### Framework for Agency: The Dial Approach

One of Thomson Reuters' most significant contributions to the LLMOps discourse is their conceptualization of agency not as a binary characteristic but as a spectrum of adjustable parameters. They identify four key ""dials"" that can be tuned based on use case requirements and risk tolerance:

Autonomy Dial: Ranges from simple discrete tasks like document summarization to complex self-evolving workflows where AI systems plan, execute, and replan their own work based on observations and learning. This flexibility allows them to match the level of AI independence to the specific requirements and risk profile of different use cases.

Context Dial: Progresses from basic parametric knowledge utilization through RAG implementations with single knowledge sources, to sophisticated multi-source reasoning that can rationalize between controlled knowledge bases and web content. At the most advanced level, their systems can even modify data sources and schemas to improve future performance.

Memory Dial: Evolves from stateless RAG systems that retrieve context at query time to sophisticated memory architectures that maintain state throughout workflows, across execution steps, and persist across user sessions. This persistent memory capability is crucial for complex legal and tax workflows that may span multiple sessions and require continuity of context.

Coordination Dial: Spans from atomic task execution to full multi-agent collaboration systems. This includes delegation to tools and coordination between multiple AI agents working together on complex problems.

This framework provides a practical approach to managing the complexity and risk associated with agentic systems, allowing operators to dial up agency in low-risk, exploratory scenarios while maintaining tighter control in high-precision, high-stakes situations.

### Production Challenges and Solutions

Evaluation Complexity: Thomson Reuters identifies evaluation as perhaps their most challenging aspect of LLMOps. The fundamental tension between user expectations of deterministic behavior and the inherently non-deterministic nature of LLM systems creates significant trust and adoption barriers. Their evaluation challenges are compounded by the fact that even highly trained domain experts (lawyers, tax professionals) show 10+ percent variability in their own judgments when evaluating the same questions a week apart.

This human variability insight is particularly valuable for the LLMOps community, as it highlights that the challenge isn't just technical inconsistency in AI systems, but fundamental variability in human expert judgment. Their approach involves developing rigorous evaluation rubrics while ultimately relying on preference-based evaluation as a north star for determining system improvement.

The evaluation process is also expensive, requiring highly trained professionals (lawyers, tax experts) who command significant compensation. This creates a practical constraint on iteration speed and evaluation frequency, forcing them to be strategic about when and how they conduct evaluations.

Agentic System Evaluation Challenges: As systems become more agentic, evaluation becomes significantly more complex. Key challenges include:

• Difficulty in maintaining proper source citations as agents perform more complex reasoning
• Agent drift detection and diagnosis along multi-step trajectories
• Building effective guardrail systems that require deep domain expertise
• Balancing automation with explainability and auditability requirements
### Legacy System Integration Strategy

Rather than viewing their extensive legacy infrastructure as a constraint, Thomson Reuters has transformed it into a competitive advantage through decomposition and tool integration. With over 100 years of software development, they possess highly tuned domain logic and business rules that users expect and depend upon.

Their key insight was that agentic systems could decompose these legacy applications into discrete tools that AI agents can leverage. Instead of rebuilding everything from scratch, they're finding new ways to utilize existing infrastructure, turning what might be considered technical debt into unique assets.

This approach is exemplified in their tax automation system, which uses existing tax engines and validation systems as tools that AI agents can call upon. The AI handles document processing, data extraction, and field mapping, while leveraging the proven calculation and validation logic embedded in their legacy systems.

### Production Use Cases

Tax Workflow Automation: Their tax use case demonstrates end-to-end automation of tax return generation from source documents. The system uses AI for document data extraction (W2s, 1099s, etc.), intelligent field mapping to tax engines, application of tax law rules and conditions, and generation of complete tax returns. The integration with existing tax engines and validation systems allows the AI to inspect errors, seek additional information from source documents, and iteratively resolve issues to complete workflows.

Legal Research System: Their legal research implementation showcases sophisticated multi-source reasoning across their 1.5+ terabytes of proprietary content. The system uses existing litigation research tools as building blocks, including document search, retrieval, citation comparison, and validation capabilities. The AI agent navigates across case law, statutes, regulations, and legal commentary to construct comprehensive research reports with proper citations and risk flagging.

Both systems demonstrate the practical application of their agency dial framework, with the tax system operating at higher autonomy levels due to more structured workflows, while the legal research system maintains more human oversight due to the interpretive nature of legal analysis.

### Technical Architecture Insights

While specific technical details aren't extensively covered in the presentation, several architectural insights emerge:

Multi-Source RAG: Their systems integrate multiple content sources with different characteristics - proprietary databases, licensed content, and public information - requiring sophisticated reasoning about source authority and relevance.

Tool Integration: Rather than monolithic AI systems, they've built architectures where AI agents coordinate with existing software tools and engines, maintaining the reliability of proven business logic while adding AI capabilities for reasoning and orchestration.

Citation and Traceability: Maintaining proper citations and source traceability is a core requirement, with their systems providing ""hard citations"" linking back to original cases, statutes, and other authoritative sources.

Risk Flagging: Their systems incorporate risk assessment capabilities, flagging potential issues or uncertainty levels in their outputs, which is crucial for professional service environments.

### Organizational and Resource Commitments

Thomson Reuters' LLMOps success is supported by significant organizational investment:

• 4,500 domain experts (described as the world's largest employer of lawyers)
• Applied research lab with 200+ scientists and engineers
• $200+ million annual capital investment in AI product development
• Over $3 billion in recent acquisitions to expand capabilities
This scale of investment underscores that successful enterprise LLMOps, particularly in regulated industries, requires substantial organizational commitment and resources.

### Key Lessons for LLMOps Practitioners

Rethink MVP Approach: Thomson Reuters found that their traditional focus on ""minimal"" in MVP led them down optimization rabbit holes. They discovered that building complete systems first, then optimizing, was more effective than trying to perfect individual components in isolation. This insight challenges conventional product development wisdom in the context of agentic AI systems.

Leverage Unique Assets: Their success stems from identifying and leveraging assets that competitors cannot easily replicate - domain expertise, proprietary content, and established user relationships. This suggests that successful LLMOps strategies should be built around unique organizational assets rather than generic AI capabilities.

Human-in-the-Loop Evaluation: Given the inherent variability in expert human judgment, they emphasize the critical importance of developing robust evaluation frameworks that account for this variability while still providing meaningful signals for system improvement.

Agency as Risk Management: Their dial framework provides a practical approach to managing the risk-capability tradeoff in agentic systems, allowing organizations to be aggressive with automation in low-risk scenarios while maintaining control in high-stakes situations.

The Thomson Reuters case study demonstrates that successful enterprise LLMOps requires more than just technical implementation - it demands strategic thinking about agency levels, systematic approaches to evaluation, creative integration with existing systems, and substantial organizational commitment to both technology and domain expertise.

https://woolion.art/2025/01/02/DEFECTIVE.html

## Short Summary

JOBifAI, a game leveraging LLMs for interactive gameplay, encountered significant challenges with LLM safety filters in production. The developers implemented a retry-based solution to handle both technical failures and safety filter triggers, achieving a 99% success rate after three retries. However, the experience highlighted fundamental issues with current safety filter implementations, including lack of transparency, inconsistent behavior, and potential cost implications, ultimately limiting the game's development from proof-of-concept to full production.

## Long Summary

This case study explores the challenges and solutions implemented by the developers of JOBifAI, a game that integrates LLMs to create innovative gameplay mechanics. The study provides valuable insights into the practical challenges of deploying LLMs in production, particularly focusing on the implementation and impact of safety filters in an interactive entertainment context.

## Overview and Context

JOBifAI is an interactive game where players engage with AI-generated content in a job interview scenario. The game's premise involves players submitting an AI-generated portfolio and participating in subsequent interactions. This setup creates an environment where maintaining appropriate social behavior is integral to the gameplay mechanics.

## Technical Implementation and Challenges

The development team implemented a sophisticated prompt structure for handling player interactions:

• Each prompt includes three main components:
The system expects responses in a specific JSON format: {""choice"": c, ""sentence"": s}, where 'c' represents the category of the player's action, and 's' provides the resulting description.

The team identified three primary failure modes in their production environment:

• JSON parsing failures (HTTP 400 responses)
• Schema validation failures (even after type casting attempts)
• Safety filter rejections (also resulting in HTTP 400 responses)
A significant challenge in production was the inability to differentiate between technical failures and safety-related rejections, as they all resulted in the same HTTP status code. This lack of granularity in error handling forced the team to implement a somewhat crude but effective retry mechanism.

## Production Solution and Performance

The development team implemented a three-retry system to handle failures:

• First attempt: ~75% success rate
• Second attempt: ~90% cumulative success rate
• Third attempt: ~99% cumulative success rate
These success rates, while not based on hard metrics, were derived from extensive playtesting and real-world usage patterns. The solution, while not elegant, proved effective enough for the proof-of-concept stage.

## Safety Filter Implementation Analysis

The case study provides valuable insights into the practical implications of safety filters in production LLM applications:

• Inconsistent Behavior: The safety filters often triggered unpredictably, making it difficult to implement reliable error handling
• Cost Implications: Multiple retries increased the cost per query, particularly for users whose inputs frequently triggered safety filters
• User Experience Impact: The lack of clear error differentiation made it challenging to provide appropriate feedback to users
The team identified several potential improvements for safety filter implementations in production environments:

• Granular Error Codes: Suggesting the implementation of specific error codes for different types of safety concerns:
• Cost Management: The current implementation forces developers to either absorb or pass on the costs of multiple retries to users, creating uncertainty in the business model
## Production Limitations and Impact

The case study reveals several critical limitations of current safety filter implementations in production:

• Reliability Issues: Safety filters proved to be even less reliable than standard LLM responses
• Resource Waste: The need for multiple retries led to unnecessary computation and increased costs
• Development Constraints: The unreliable foundation of safety filters ultimately deterred the team from expanding beyond the proof-of-concept stage
## Lessons Learned and Recommendations

The case study offers several valuable insights for LLMOps practitioners:

• Error Handling Design: Implement robust retry mechanisms while being mindful of cost implications
• Safety Filter Integration: Consider the balance between safety requirements and user experience
• Cost Management: Plan for and monitor the impact of retry mechanisms on operational costs
• Error Transparency: Push for more granular error reporting from LLM providers
The experience of JOBifAI demonstrates that while safety filters are necessary, their current implementation creates significant challenges for production applications. The case study suggests that more transparent and reliable safety filter implementations would enable developers to build better user experiences while maintaining appropriate safety standards.

## Future Considerations

The case study points to several areas for improvement in LLMOps practices:

• Better error handling and reporting mechanisms from LLM providers
• More transparent safety filter implementations
• Cost-effective retry strategies
• Clear differentiation between technical and content-based failures
While JOBifAI successfully implemented a working solution, the case study highlights the need for more sophisticated approaches to safety filters in production LLM applications, particularly for interactive and real-time use cases.

## Short Summary

Propel developed and tested AI-powered tools to help SNAP recipients diagnose and resolve benefits interruptions, addressing the problem of ""program churn"" that affects about 200,000 of their 5 million monthly users. They implemented two approaches: a structured triage flow using AI code generation for California users, and a conversational AI chat assistant powered by Decagon for nationwide deployment. Both tests showed promising results including strong user uptake (53% usage rate), faster benefits restoration, and improved user experience with multilingual support, while reducing administrative burden on state agencies.

## Long Summary

## Overview

Propel, a company serving over 5 million monthly users who manage their SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) benefits, developed and deployed AI-powered tools to address a critical problem affecting approximately 200,000 users monthly: interruptions in benefit deposits due to administrative issues. This case study demonstrates practical applications of LLMs in government services, specifically targeting the reduction of ""program churn"" - situations where eligible recipients experience lapses in benefits due to paperwork or procedural issues rather than actual ineligibility.

The company's approach represents a thoughtful implementation of AI in production environments serving vulnerable populations, with careful attention to monitoring, escalation procedures, and measured deployment strategies. Their work addresses both immediate user needs and broader systemic inefficiencies in government benefit administration.

## Technical Implementation and Architecture

Propel implemented two distinct AI-powered solutions, each representing different approaches to LLM deployment in production systems serving government benefits recipients.

### Test 1: AI-Generated Triage Flow System

The first implementation focused on California's CalFresh program and utilized AI primarily for code generation rather than direct user interaction. This approach demonstrates an important LLMOps pattern where AI capabilities are leveraged in the development process to accelerate the creation of complex decision-tree systems.

The technical architecture involved using AI models to generate code for multi-step diagnostic flows based on written logic trees. This represents a hybrid approach where human expertise defines the decision logic, but AI accelerates the implementation process. The system guides users through structured questions to diagnose why their benefits deposit might be missing and directs them to appropriate resolution actions.

The choice to focus initially on California was strategically sound from both a technical and policy perspective. California's more flexible periodic report policies and the availability of online self-service through BenefitsCal provided a higher probability of successful outcomes, making it an ideal environment for testing AI-powered interventions. This demonstrates good LLMOps practice of starting with scenarios most likely to succeed before expanding to more challenging environments.

### Test 2: Conversational AI Chat Assistant

The second implementation represents a more sophisticated application of LLMs in production, using Decagon as the underlying generative AI platform. This system provides real-time, context-aware assistance to users nationwide, demonstrating several advanced LLMOps capabilities.

The conversational AI system was designed to handle a wide range of scenarios dynamically, generating responses tailored to specific states and individual circumstances. This required the system to understand complex benefit program rules across multiple jurisdictions and provide accurate, actionable guidance. The technical implementation included real-time monitoring, escalation procedures, and performance tracking - all critical components of production LLM systems.

One of the most impressive technical achievements was the system's ability to handle unexpected situations that weren't explicitly programmed. The AI model successfully interpreted state-specific abbreviations like ""smrf"" (Hawaii's Six Month Report Form) and seamlessly switched languages mid-conversation when users began communicating in Haitian Creole. This demonstrates the robust contextual understanding capabilities of modern LLMs when properly deployed in production environments.

## Production Deployment and Monitoring

Both implementations demonstrate mature LLMOps practices in their approach to production deployment and monitoring. The team conducted small-scale tests with approximately 1,000 users each, allowing for careful monitoring and manual handling of escalations where necessary. This graduated deployment approach is a best practice in LLMOps, particularly when serving vulnerable populations where system failures could have serious consequences.

The monitoring infrastructure included user rating systems, performance tracking, and escalation procedures to human operators when the AI system detected it could not adequately help with an issue. This human-in-the-loop approach represents responsible AI deployment, ensuring that users receive appropriate support even when the automated system reaches its limits.

The team's approach to evaluation was methodologically sound, using randomized testing with control groups to measure key outcomes including days to next deposit and rates of restored benefits. This demonstrates proper evaluation practices for LLM systems in production, focusing on measurable business outcomes rather than just technical metrics.

## Performance and User Experience

The results from both tests show promising outcomes for AI-powered benefits navigation. The conversational AI system achieved a 53% uptake rate among eligible users, indicating strong demand for this type of assistance. Both systems showed improvements in two critical metrics: faster benefits restoration and higher rates of same-month benefit restoration, helping users avoid the lengthy reapplication process.

User feedback was generally positive, with very few negative ratings among those who provided feedback. The system's ability to provide multilingual support without explicit programming for this capability demonstrates the inherent advantages of LLM-based systems over traditional rule-based approaches.

The technical performance included successful handling of edge cases and unexpected user behaviors, suggesting robust system design and appropriate model selection for the use case. The ability to maintain context across conversations and provide state-specific guidance shows sophisticated prompt engineering and knowledge base integration.

## Challenges and Limitations

While the case study presents generally positive results, it's important to note the limited scale of the tests and the careful monitoring required. The need for human escalation procedures indicates that the AI systems, while helpful, were not fully autonomous solutions. This is appropriate given the critical nature of the service but represents an ongoing operational cost.

The focus on specific types of benefit interruptions (periodic reports and recertifications) suggests that the current implementation may not address all possible causes of benefit lapses. The systems appear to work best for procedural issues rather than more complex eligibility determinations, which is a reasonable limitation but one that affects the overall impact potential.

The reliance on users having smartphones and digital literacy to access these tools also represents a potential limitation in reaching all affected populations, though this aligns with Propel's existing user base and service model.

## Broader Implications for LLMOps

This case study demonstrates several important principles for LLMOps in government and social services contexts. The emphasis on careful monitoring, graduated deployment, and human oversight shows how AI systems can be responsibly deployed in high-stakes environments. The use of AI for both code generation and direct user interaction illustrates the versatility of current LLM capabilities.

The success of the multilingual support and contextual understanding features suggests that LLMs can provide more flexible and responsive user experiences than traditional automated systems. This has implications for broader applications in government services where users may have diverse linguistic backgrounds and varying levels of familiarity with bureaucratic processes.

The approach to knowledge base integration and state-specific guidance demonstrates how LLMs can be effectively used to navigate complex, jurisdiction-specific rules and procedures. This could be applicable to many other government services beyond SNAP benefits.

## Future Developments and Scalability

The case study outlines several directions for future development, including proactive reminders, better integration with state benefit portals, and expanded coverage of different types of benefit interruptions. These developments would require further LLMOps maturation, including more sophisticated monitoring systems and potentially more advanced AI capabilities.

The identification that 25% of Propel users don't use their state's online benefit portals represents a significant opportunity for AI-powered guidance to bridge digital divides. This suggests potential for AI systems to serve as interfaces between users and complex government systems, potentially reducing the need for direct human intervention in routine cases.

The team's recommendation to start with small-scale pilots with close monitoring and human support for escalations provides a template for other organizations looking to implement similar AI-powered government services. This approach balances innovation with responsibility, ensuring that vulnerable populations receive appropriate support while advancing the capabilities of AI systems in production environments.

## Short Summary

Bell developed a sophisticated hybrid RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system combining batch and incremental processing to handle both static and dynamic knowledge bases. The solution addresses challenges in managing constantly changing documentation while maintaining system performance. They created a modular architecture using Apache Beam, Cloud Composer (Airflow), and GCP services, allowing for both scheduled batch updates and real-time document processing. The system has been successfully deployed for multiple use cases including HR policy queries and dynamic Confluence documentation management.

## Long Summary

Bell, a major telecommunications company, has developed an innovative approach to implementing RAG systems at scale. This case study details their journey in creating a flexible and maintainable architecture for managing knowledge bases that can handle both static and dynamic content updates.

The primary challenge they faced was building a RAG system that could efficiently handle knowledge bases of varying update frequencies - from relatively static HR policies to frequently updated Confluence pages. They needed a solution that could maintain data lineage, handle different document processing requirements, and scale efficiently while staying within platform quotas and infrastructure constraints.

### Architecture and Technical Implementation

The team developed a hybrid architecture combining two main approaches:

• Batch Pipeline: The primary pipeline used for initialization and large-scale updates. This handles configuration changes and large document updates that require rebuilding the entire knowledge base and vector database. It uses Cloud Composer (managed Airflow) for orchestration and Apache Beam for parallel data processing.
• Incremental Pipeline: A supplementary pipeline for handling real-time updates and small document changes. This uses a pub/sub architecture to detect document changes and process them immediately, making the updates available to the chatbot API quickly.
The solution's modularity is one of its key strengths. Each component (pre-processing, embedding, post-processing) is treated as an independent, configurable service governed by YAML configuration files. This approach allows for easy testing, debugging, and scaling of individual components.

### Knowledge Base Management

A particularly innovative aspect is their approach to knowledge base management, inspired by TensorFlow Extended's experiment management system. They implemented a structured storage system where:

• Each use case has its own root folder
• Documents are organized in curated raw document subfolders
• Processed chunks and embeddings are stored separately
• Timestamp-based subfolders track different versions and pipeline runs
The system supports two methods for document ingestion:

• A ""librarian"" approach where authorized users manually manage documents
• An automated pipeline that detects changes at the source and syncs them to the knowledge base
### Technical Implementation Details

The solution leverages several key technologies and practices:

• Infrastructure: Built on GCP, using services like Cloud Composer for orchestration and Vector Search for similarity search
• Processing Framework: Apache Beam for both batch and streaming data processing
• Document Processing: Lang Chain for document loading and chunking, with configurable parameters for different document types
• Deployment: Robust CI/CD pipelines with comprehensive testing at both unit and integration levels
• Configuration Management: YAML-based configuration files that control all aspects of the pipeline
### Production Considerations

The team paid careful attention to several production-critical aspects:

• Quota Management: Careful handling of API quotas, especially for embedding operations
• Error Handling: Robust error handling and recovery mechanisms
• Data Lineage: Comprehensive tracking of document processing steps and versions
• Testing: Implementation of test-driven development practices with thorough unit and integration testing
• Scalability: Both horizontal and vertical scaling capabilities built into the architecture
### Real-World Applications

The system has been successfully deployed for several use cases at Bell:

• HR Policy Chatbot: Handles complex policy queries with context-aware responses
• Confluence Documentation: Manages frequently updated technical documentation with near real-time updates
• Sales Information: Processes dynamic sales-related content with rapid update requirements
### Key Innovations

Some of the most notable innovations in their approach include:

• The hybrid batch/incremental architecture that provides flexibility for different update patterns
• Modular design that allows easy component updates and maintenance
• Sophisticated knowledge base management system with version tracking
• Configurable document processing pipelines that can handle various document types and requirements
### Results and Impact

The system has successfully enabled Bell to deploy multiple RAG applications across different business units. The modular architecture has significantly reduced the time needed to deploy new use cases, with most deployments requiring only configuration changes rather than new code development.

Their approach to handling dynamic knowledge bases has proven particularly valuable, allowing them to maintain up-to-date information in their RAG systems without compromising system performance or stability. The solution's ability to handle both batch and incremental updates has made it versatile enough to support various use cases with different update frequency requirements.

### Future Directions

The team has identified several areas for future development, including:

• Support for multimodal embeddings
• Enhanced document change detection capabilities
• Further optimization of processing pipelines for specific document types
The success of this implementation demonstrates the importance of treating LLMOps components as products, with proper software engineering practices, rather than just scripts or one-off solutions. Their experience shows that investing in modularity and proper architecture design pays dividends in maintainability and scalability of RAG systems in production.

## Short Summary

Vericant, an educational testing company, developed and deployed an AI-powered video interview analysis system in just 30 days. The solution automatically processes 15-minute admission interview videos to generate summaries, key points, and topic analyses, enabling admissions teams to review interviews in 20-30 seconds instead of watching full recordings. The implementation was achieved through iterative prompt engineering and a systematic evaluation framework, without requiring significant engineering resources or programming expertise.

## Long Summary

This case study explores how Vericant, a company specializing in third-party video interviews for educational institutions, successfully implemented an AI-powered solution to enhance their existing video interview platform. The company, which was later acquired by ETS (Educational Testing Service), demonstrates how even organizations with limited AI expertise can effectively deploy LLM-based solutions in production with minimal resources and technical overhead.

The Context and Business Challenge:
Vericant's core business involves facilitating video interviews for high schools and universities, particularly focusing on international student admissions. Their primary value proposition is making interviews scalable for educational institutions. However, they identified a key pain point: while they could efficiently conduct many interviews, admissions teams still needed to watch entire 15-minute videos to evaluate candidates, creating a bottleneck in the process.

The AI Solution Development Process:
The CEO, Guy Savon, took a remarkably pragmatic approach to implementing an LLM solution, which offers valuable insights into practical LLMOps implementation:

Initial Approach:

• The project began with a focus on basic but high-value features: generating short summaries, extracting key points, and identifying main topics from interview transcripts
• They deliberately branded the feature as ""AI Insights"" and labeled it as beta to set appropriate expectations
• The implementation primarily used OpenAI's GPT models through their playground interface
Prompt Engineering and Evaluation Framework:
The team developed a systematic approach to prompt engineering and evaluation:

• Created an initial system prompt that positioned the AI as an assistant to admissions officers
• Included specific instructions about tone, language use, and how to refer to students
• Developed the prompt iteratively based on testing results
• For each transcript, they generated three different outputs using the same prompt to assess consistency
• Created a structured evaluation framework using Google Sheets
• Implemented a quantitative scoring system (ranging from ""amazing"" to ""unsatisfactory"")
• Had team members watch original videos and compare them with AI outputs
• Collected specific feedback about issues and areas for improvement
Quality Assurance Process:
The evaluation process was particularly noteworthy for its thoroughness:

• Team members reviewed each AI output against the original video
• Used a color-coding system (dark green, green, yellow, red) to visualize quality levels
• Gathered detailed comments about specific issues
• Iterated on the prompt based on evaluation results until achieving consistent high-quality outputs
Implementation Strategy:
Several key aspects of their implementation strategy stand out:

• Developed the solution with minimal engineering resources
• Used existing tools (OpenAI Playground, Google Sheets) rather than building custom infrastructure
• Implemented the solution part-time over a few weeks
• Focused on quick deployment rather than perfection
• Integrated the AI insights directly into their existing admission officer portal
Results and Impact:
The implementation has been successful in several ways:

• Reduced interview review time from 15 minutes to 20-30 seconds
• Maintained high quality through careful prompt engineering and evaluation
• Created a new business opportunity by addressing the scalability of interview processing
• Positioned Vericant as an early adopter of AI in their industry
Key LLMOps Lessons:
The case study offers several valuable lessons for organizations implementing LLMs in production:

• Start small but think strategically about scaling
• Use existing tools and platforms rather than building from scratch
• Implement systematic evaluation frameworks
• Focus on iterative improvement
• Be transparent about AI usage and set appropriate expectations
• Consider user experience and integration with existing workflows
The project also demonstrates important principles about LLM deployment:

• The importance of proper prompt engineering
• The value of systematic evaluation frameworks

## Short Summary

UC Berkeley researchers studied how organizations struggle with building reliable LLM pipelines for unstructured data processing, identifying two critical gaps: data understanding and intent specification. They developed DocETL, a research framework that helps users systematically iterate on LLM pipelines by first understanding failure modes in their data, then clarifying prompt specifications, and finally applying accuracy optimization strategies, moving beyond the common advice of simply ""iterate on your prompts.""

## Long Summary

This case study presents research conducted at UC Berkeley on the challenges organizations face when building reliable LLM pipelines for data processing tasks. The research, led by PhD candidate Shrea, addresses a fundamental problem in LLMOps: while there are numerous tools for improving LLM accuracy once a pipeline is well-specified, there is virtually no tooling to help users understand their data and specify their intent clearly.

The research emerged from observing how organizations across various domains struggle with unstructured data processing tasks. These include customer service review analysis for theme extraction and actionable insights, sales email analysis to identify missed opportunities, and safety analysis in traffic and aviation domains to understand accident causes. The common thread across all these applications is that users consistently report that ""prompts don't work"" and are typically advised to simply ""iterate on your prompts"" without systematic guidance.

To illustrate the complexity of the problem, the researchers used a real estate example where an agent wants to identify neighborhoods with restrictive pet policies. This seemingly straightforward task requires a sequence of LLM operations: mapping documents to extract relevant information, categorizing clauses, and aggregating results by neighborhood. However, users quickly discover that their initial assumptions about what they want to extract are often incomplete or incorrect.

The research identified two critical gaps in current LLMOps practices. The first is the data understanding gap, where users don't initially know what types of documents exist in their dataset or what unique failure modes occur for each document type. For instance, pet policy clauses might include breed restrictions, quantity limits, weight restrictions, service animal exemptions, and various other categories that users only discover through data exploration. The challenge is compounded by the long tail of failure modes, where hundreds of different issues can emerge in even a thousand-document collection.

The second gap is intent specification, where users struggle to translate their understanding of failure modes into concrete pipeline improvements. Even when users identify problems, they often get lost deciding whether to use prompt engineering, add new operations, implement task decomposition, or apply other optimization strategies.

DocETL, the research framework developed by the team, addresses these gaps through several innovative approaches. For the data understanding gap, the system automatically extracts and clusters different types of outputs, allowing users to identify failure modes and design targeted evaluations. The tool organizes failure modes and helps users create datasets for specific evaluation scenarios. For example, in the real estate case, the system might identify that clauses are phrased unusually, that LLMs overfit to certain keywords, or that extraction occurs for unrelated content due to keyword associations.

For the intent specification gap, DocETL provides functionality to translate user-provided notes into prompt improvements through an interactive interface. This allows users to maintain revision history and provides full steerability over the optimization process. The system helps users systematically improve their pipelines rather than randomly trying different approaches.

The research revealed several important insights about LLMOps practices that extend beyond data processing applications. First, evaluations in real-world LLM applications are inherently fuzzy and never truly complete. Users continuously discover new failure modes as they run their pipelines, constantly creating new evaluation subsets and test cases. This challenges the traditional notion of having a fixed evaluation dataset.

Second, failure modes consistently exhibit a long tail distribution. Users typically encounter tens or twenties of different failure modes that require ongoing monitoring and testing. This complexity makes it impossible to rely on simple accuracy metrics and necessitates more sophisticated evaluation frameworks.

Third, the research emphasized the importance of unpacking the iteration cycle into distinct stages rather than attempting to optimize everything simultaneously. The recommended approach involves three sequential phases: first, understanding the data and identifying failure modes without worrying about accuracy; second, achieving well-specified prompts that eliminate ambiguity; and third, applying established accuracy optimization strategies.

This staged approach challenges common LLMOps practices where teams attempt to optimize accuracy while simultaneously trying to understand their data and refine their objectives. The research suggests that gains from well-known optimization strategies are only achieved after the foundational work of data understanding and intent specification is completed.

The implications for LLMOps practitioners are significant. The research suggests that much of the current tooling ecosystem focuses on the final stage of optimization while neglecting the earlier, more fundamental challenges of data understanding and intent specification. This creates a situation where practitioners struggle with the foundational aspects of their pipelines while having access to sophisticated tools for problems they're not yet ready to solve.

The work also highlights the importance of human-in-the-loop approaches for LLMOps. Rather than pursuing fully automated optimization, the research demonstrates value in tools that help users systematically explore their data, understand failure modes, and iteratively refine their specifications with appropriate tooling support.

From a broader LLMOps perspective, this research contributes to understanding the full lifecycle of LLM pipeline development. It suggests that successful LLM deployments require not just technical infrastructure for model serving and monitoring, but also sophisticated tooling for data exploration, failure mode analysis, and iterative specification refinement.

The research methodology itself provides insights for LLMOps teams. By combining research approaches with human-computer interaction (HCI) methodologies, the team was able to identify systematic patterns in how users struggle with LLM pipeline development. This suggests that LLMOps practices can benefit from more systematic study of user workflows and challenges rather than focusing solely on technical optimization.

While the research presents promising approaches through DocETL, it's important to note that this represents early-stage academic work rather than a mature commercial solution. The practical applicability of these approaches in large-scale production environments remains to be validated. However, the systematic analysis of LLMOps challenges and the proposed framework for addressing them provide valuable insights for practitioners working on similar problems.

The emphasis on evaluation and testing throughout the research aligns with broader trends in LLMOps toward more sophisticated evaluation frameworks. The recognition that evaluations are never complete and must continuously evolve reflects the dynamic nature of LLM applications in production environments.

## Short Summary

Google Research developed a ""Wayfinding AI"" prototype based on Gemini to address the challenge of people struggling to find relevant, personalized health information online. Through formative user research with 33 participants and iterative design, they created an AI agent that proactively asks clarifying questions to understand user goals and context before providing answers. In a randomized study with 130 participants, the Wayfinding AI was significantly preferred over a baseline Gemini model across multiple dimensions including helpfulness, relevance, goal understanding, and tailoring, demonstrating that a context-seeking, conversational approach creates more empowering health information experiences than traditional question-answering systems.

## Long Summary

## Overview and Use Case Context

Google Research's Wayfinding AI represents a production-oriented research prototype that explores how LLMs can be deployed to help people navigate complex health information. The case study centers on a fundamental design challenge in LLMOps: how to move beyond simple question-answering paradigms to create AI systems that actively understand user context and guide conversations toward more helpful outcomes. This work is particularly notable because it demonstrates an iterative, user-centered approach to deploying LLMs in a sensitive domain (healthcare information) where accuracy, relevance, and user trust are paramount.

The use case addresses a well-documented problem: people searching for health information online often struggle to articulate their concerns effectively and are overwhelmed by generic, non-personalized content. The research team's hypothesis was that by designing an AI agent to proactively seek context through clarifying questions—mimicking how healthcare professionals interact with patients—they could deliver more tailored and helpful information experiences. This represents a departure from the typical LLM deployment pattern of providing comprehensive answers immediately.

## Technical Architecture and LLMOps Implementation

The Wayfinding AI is built on top of Gemini, specifically using Gemini 2.5 Flash as the baseline model in their comparative studies. The system implements a sophisticated prompt engineering approach that orchestrates three core behaviors at each conversational turn. First, it generates up to three targeted clarifying questions designed to systematically reduce ambiguity about the user's health concern. Second, it produces a ""best-effort"" answer based on the information available so far, acknowledging that this answer can be improved with additional context. Third, it provides transparent reasoning that explains how the user's latest responses have refined the AI's understanding and answer.

From an LLMOps perspective, this architecture requires careful prompt design to balance multiple objectives simultaneously: asking relevant questions, providing provisional answers, maintaining conversational coherence, and explaining reasoning—all while ensuring medical appropriateness and safety. The system must dynamically adapt its questioning strategy based on the conversation history and the specific health topic, which suggests sophisticated context management and potentially multi-step prompting or agent-based architectures.

The interface design itself is a critical component of the production system. The team created a two-column layout that separates the interactive conversational stream (left column, containing user messages and clarifying questions) from the informational content (right column, containing best-effort answers and detailed explanations). This design decision emerged from user research showing that clarifying questions could be easily missed when embedded in long paragraphs of text. This highlights an important LLMOps lesson: the interface through which LLM outputs are presented can be as critical as the model outputs themselves for user experience and system effectiveness.

## User Research and Iterative Development Process

The development process exemplifies best practices in LLMOps, particularly around evaluation and iteration. The team conducted four separate mixed-method user experience studies with a total of 163 participants. The formative research phase involved 33 participants and revealed critical insights that shaped the system design. Participants reported struggling to articulate health concerns, describing their search process as throwing ""all the words in there"" to see what comes back. This insight directly informed the proactive questioning strategy.

During prototype testing, the team discovered that users strongly preferred a ""deferred-answer"" approach where the AI asks questions before providing comprehensive answers, with one participant noting it ""feels more like the way it would work if you talk to a doctor."" However, the research also revealed important failure modes: engagement dropped when questions were poorly formulated, irrelevant, or difficult to find in the interface. This kind of qualitative feedback is invaluable for production LLM systems, as it identifies not just what works but under what conditions systems fail.

The evaluation methodology itself demonstrates sophisticated LLMOps practices. The final validation study used a randomized within-subjects design with 130 participants, where each person interacted with both the Wayfinding AI and a baseline Gemini model. This controlled comparison allowed for direct measurement of the intervention's impact while controlling for individual variation in health topics and information needs. Participants were required to spend at least 3 minutes with each system and could optionally share their conversation histories, balancing research needs with privacy considerations.

## Evaluation Framework and Metrics

The team measured six specific dimensions of user experience: helpfulness, relevance of questions asked, tailoring to situation, goal understanding, ease of use, and efficiency of getting useful information. This multi-dimensional evaluation framework goes beyond simple satisfaction scores to capture specific aspects of LLM performance that matter for production deployment. The results showed that Wayfinding AI was significantly preferred for helpfulness, relevance, goal understanding, and tailoring, though not necessarily for ease of use or efficiency—an honest acknowledgment that the more sophisticated interaction pattern may involve some tradeoffs.

Beyond preference metrics, the team analyzed conversation patterns themselves, finding that Wayfinding AI conversations were notably longer (4.96 turns on average vs. 3.29 for baseline when understanding symptom causes) and had different structural characteristics. They visualized conversation flows using Sankey diagrams showing that Wayfinding AI conversations contained substantially more user responses to clarifying questions. This behavioral evidence complements the self-reported preferences and demonstrates that the system actually changes how users interact with the AI, not just how they perceive it.

From an LLMOps perspective, this evaluation approach is noteworthy because it combines quantitative metrics (turn counts, preference ratings), qualitative feedback (open-ended responses about what users learned), and behavioral analysis (conversation flow patterns). This triangulation provides robust evidence for production readiness that goes beyond typical accuracy metrics. It also demonstrates the importance of human evaluation for conversational AI systems where traditional offline metrics may not capture user experience quality.

## Production Considerations and Challenges

While presented as a research prototype, the case study reveals several important production considerations. The team was careful to exclude certain types of health inquiries (details provided in the paper), implement informed consent processes, and instruct participants not to share identifying information. These safeguards reflect the regulatory and ethical considerations necessary when deploying LLMs in healthcare contexts, even for informational purposes.

The team also addresses potential limitations transparently. They note that effectiveness depends heavily on execution quality—poorly formulated questions or irrelevant clarifications damage user engagement. This suggests that production deployment would require robust quality assurance mechanisms, potentially including human review of generated questions, continuous monitoring of conversation quality, and mechanisms to detect and recover from poor interactions. The paper's emphasis on ""transparent reasoning"" also reflects awareness that healthcare applications require explainability, which may necessitate additional prompt engineering or architectural components beyond basic LLM generation.

The two-column interface represents another production consideration: it departs from familiar chat interfaces, which could affect adoption. While the study showed users still preferred the system overall, the team acknowledges this may involve ease-of-use tradeoffs. This raises questions about how to introduce novel interaction patterns in production while managing user expectations and learning curves.

## Context Management and Conversational State

A critical but somewhat implicit aspect of the LLMOps implementation is how the system maintains conversational context across multiple turns while managing increasingly complex user histories. Each turn must incorporate the user's original question, all subsequent clarifying questions, all user responses, and previous best-effort answers to generate appropriate follow-up questions and updated answers. This context management challenge is central to any multi-turn conversational system and likely requires careful prompt design to keep context within model token limits while maintaining coherence.

The system's ability to explain ""how the user's latest answers have helped refine the previous answer"" suggests it maintains explicit models of information gain across turns. This could be implemented through meta-prompting (asking the LLM to reflect on how new information changes its understanding) or through separate reasoning steps that track which aspects of ambiguity have been resolved. Either approach represents sophisticated prompt engineering beyond simple question-answer patterns.

## Broader LLMOps Lessons and Implications

This case study offers several valuable lessons for LLMOps practitioners. First, it demonstrates that user research and iterative design are as important as model selection for production LLM systems. The Wayfinding AI's success stems not primarily from using a different model but from careful design of interaction patterns based on user needs. Second, it shows that familiar interaction patterns (immediate comprehensive answers) are not always optimal, and that departing from defaults can yield significant user experience improvements when grounded in research.

Third, the work highlights that evaluation for production systems must go beyond accuracy metrics to capture user experience dimensions like relevance, tailoring, and goal understanding. Fourth, it demonstrates the value of comparative studies with baseline systems to isolate the impact of specific design choices. Finally, it reinforces that interface design and information architecture are integral to LLMOps, not separate concerns—the two-column layout was essential to making the proactive questioning approach work.

The team's approach to transparency and limitations is also worth noting. They acknowledge that this is a research prototype, identify specific conditions under which the approach fails, and describe exclusion criteria and safeguards. This balanced presentation, while potentially reflecting the academic context, provides a model for how to communicate about LLM systems responsibly in production contexts. The team's work suggests that successful deployment of LLMs for complex information needs requires not just powerful models but careful attention to conversational design, user research, multi-dimensional evaluation, and appropriate interface design—a holistic LLMOps approach that integrates technical and human factors considerations throughout the development lifecycle.

## Short Summary

Gardenia Technologies partnered with AWS to develop Report GenAI, an automated ESG reporting solution that helps organizations reduce sustainability reporting time by up to 75%. The system uses agentic AI on Amazon Bedrock to automatically pre-fill ESG disclosure reports by integrating data from corporate databases, document stores, and web searches, while maintaining human oversight for validation and refinement. Omni Helicopters International successfully reduced their CDP reporting time from one month to one week using this solution.

## Long Summary

## Company and Use Case Overview

Gardenia Technologies, a data analytics company specializing in sustainability solutions, partnered with the AWS Prototyping and Cloud Engineering (PACE) team to address a critical pain point in corporate sustainability reporting. The challenge stems from the growing complexity and burden of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) reporting requirements, where 55% of sustainability leaders cite excessive administrative work in report preparation, and 70% indicate that reporting demands inhibit their ability to execute strategic initiatives.

The solution, called Report GenAI, represents a sophisticated implementation of agentic AI in production that automates the labor-intensive process of ESG data collection and report generation. The system addresses the fundamental challenge that organizations face when dealing with frameworks like the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), which comprises 1,200 individual data points, or voluntary disclosures like the CDP with approximately 150 questions covering climate risk, water stewardship, and energy consumption.

## Technical Architecture and LLMOps Implementation

Report GenAI demonstrates a comprehensive serverless architecture built on AWS services, showcasing several key LLMOps patterns and practices. The system is architected around six core components that work together to create a scalable, production-ready agentic AI solution.

The central component is an agent executor that leverages Amazon Bedrock's foundation models, specifically Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 3.5 and Haiku 3.5, to orchestrate complex ESG reporting tasks. The agent uses the Reason and Act (ReAct) prompting technique, which enables large language models to generate both reasoning traces and task-specific actions in an interleaved manner. This approach allows the system to break down complex reporting requirements, plan optimal sequences of actions, and iterate on responses until they meet quality standards.

The LLMOps implementation showcases sophisticated prompt engineering and model orchestration through the LangChain framework. The system uses Pydantic for schema enforcement through ReportSpec definitions, ensuring that outputs conform to specific reporting standards like CDP or TCFD. This demonstrates a mature approach to output validation and structured generation that is crucial for production LLM applications.

The multi-modal data integration capabilities represent another significant LLMOps achievement. The system integrates three distinct data access patterns: a text-to-SQL tool for structured data analysis, a RAG tool for unstructured document retrieval, and a web search tool for public information gathering. This hybrid approach addresses the reality that ESG data exists across multiple formats and sources within enterprise environments.

## Data Processing and Embedding Pipeline

The embedding generation pipeline demonstrates production-ready LLMOps practices for document processing and knowledge base creation. The system uses Amazon Step Functions for orchestration, Amazon Textract for document text extraction, and Amazon Titan Text Embeddings for vectorization. While Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases could have provided an end-to-end solution, Gardenia Technologies chose a custom implementation to maintain full control over design choices including text extraction approaches, embedding model selection, and vector database configuration.

The RAG implementation uses an in-memory Faiss index as a vector store, with persistence on Amazon S3 and on-demand loading. This design choice reflects the intermittent usage patterns typical of ESG reporting, where high utilization occurs during quarterly or annual reporting periods followed by lower usage. The architecture demonstrates thoughtful consideration of cost optimization and resource management in production LLM deployments.

## Production Deployment and Scalability

The deployment architecture showcases serverless-first design principles throughout the stack. The user interface runs on Amazon ECS Fargate with auto-scaling capabilities, while the core processing logic operates on AWS Lambda functions. This approach provides automatic scaling to handle the spiky usage patterns inherent in ESG reporting workflows, where demand surges during reporting periods and remains low between cycles.

Authentication and authorization are handled through Amazon Cognito, demonstrating proper security practices for enterprise LLM applications. The system implements VPC endpoints and encrypted S3 buckets for data security, with Amazon RDS instances deployed within Gardenia's VPC for relational data storage. This architecture ensures compliance with data residency requirements while maintaining strict access controls through private network connectivity.

## Evaluation and Quality Assurance

The evaluation framework represents a sophisticated approach to LLM quality assurance in production environments. Report GenAI implements a dual-layer validation system that combines human expertise with AI-powered assessment. The human-in-the-loop approach allows ESG experts to review and validate AI-generated responses, providing primary quality control for regulatory compliance and organizational context accuracy.

The AI-powered quality assessment uses state-of-the-art LLMs on Amazon Bedrock as ""LLM judges"" to evaluate response accuracy, completeness, consistency, and mathematical correctness. This automated evaluation operates by analyzing original questions, reviewing generated responses with supporting evidence, comparing against retrieved data sources, and providing confidence scores with detailed quality assessments.

The evaluation system operates at multiple levels, including high-level question response evaluation and sub-component assessment for RAG, SQL search, and agent trajectory modules. Each component has separate evaluation sets with specific metrics, demonstrating a mature approach to production LLM monitoring and quality assurance.

## Real-World Impact and Performance

The production deployment with Omni Helicopters International provides concrete validation of the system's effectiveness. OHI reduced their CDP reporting time from one month to one week, representing a 75% reduction in effort. This case study demonstrates the system's ability to handle real-world complexity while maintaining the quality standards required for regulatory compliance.

The interactive chat interface enables experts to verify factual accuracy, validate calculation methodologies, confirm regulatory compliance, and flag discrepancies. The AI reasoning module provides transparency into the agent's decision-making process, showing not only what answers were generated but how the agent arrived at those conclusions. This transparency is crucial for building trust in production LLM applications, particularly in regulated environments.

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

The system addresses several key challenges in production LLM deployment. The text-to-SQL component includes SQL linters and error-correction loops for robustness, acknowledging that LLMs can generate syntactically incorrect queries. The multi-source data integration requires careful prompt engineering to ensure the agent selects appropriate tools and data sources for different types of questions.

The intermittent usage patterns required careful architectural decisions around resource management and cost optimization. The choice to use in-memory vector stores with S3 persistence, rather than always-on vector databases, reflects practical considerations for production deployments with irregular usage patterns.

## Model Management and Evolution

The system design anticipates model evolution and upgrading, with the capability to swap foundation models as more capable or cost-effective options become available on Amazon Bedrock. The recent availability of Amazon Nova models is specifically mentioned as an example of how the system can evolve to incorporate newer capabilities.

This forward-looking approach to model management demonstrates mature LLMOps thinking about the lifecycle of LLM-powered applications. The abstraction layers provided by Amazon Bedrock and LangChain enable model switching without requiring significant architectural changes, reducing the operational burden of keeping pace with rapidly evolving foundation model capabilities.

The case study represents a comprehensive example of production LLMOps implementation, showcasing sophisticated agent orchestration, multi-modal data integration, robust evaluation frameworks, and practical solutions to the challenges of deploying LLM-powered applications in regulated enterprise environments.

## Short Summary

Vannevar Labs needed to improve their sentiment analysis capabilities for defense intelligence across multiple languages, finding that GPT-4 provided insufficient accuracy (64%) and high costs. Using Databricks Mosaic AI, they successfully fine-tuned a Mistral 7B model on domain-specific data, achieving 76% accuracy while reducing latency by 75%. The entire process from development to deployment took only two weeks, enabling efficient processing of multilingual content for defense-related applications.

## Long Summary

Vannevar Labs presents an interesting case study in transitioning from a pure API-based approach with GPT-4 to a fine-tuned custom model deployment for defense intelligence applications. The company's work focuses on supporting U.S. Department of Defense operations, particularly in understanding and tracking international communications and potential misinformation across multiple languages.

Initially, the company attempted to solve their sentiment analysis needs using GPT-4 with prompt engineering. However, this approach faced several significant challenges:

• Limited accuracy (only reaching about 64%)
• High operational costs
• Poor performance on low-resource languages like Tagalog
• Insufficient speed for real-time applications
The decision to move to a fine-tuned model architecture brought its own set of challenges, particularly around infrastructure and process management:

• GPU resource constraints and availability issues
• Complex orchestration requirements
• Need for efficient training cycles
• Data aggregation from multiple sources
• Infrastructure management overhead
Their solution leveraged Databricks Mosaic AI platform to implement a comprehensive LLMOps pipeline. The technical approach centered on fine-tuning Mistral's 7B parameter model, chosen specifically for its open-source nature and ability to run efficiently on single NVIDIA A10 Tensor Core GPU hardware. This choice reflects an important consideration in LLMOps: balancing model capability with deployment constraints and latency requirements.

The implementation process showcased several key LLMOps best practices:

• Infrastructure Management:
• Model Training Pipeline:
• Deployment Workflow:
The results demonstrated significant improvements across multiple metrics:

• Accuracy increased from 64% to 76% F1 score
• Latency reduced by 75% compared to the GPT-4 implementation
• Cost efficiency improved through optimized resource usage
• Successful handling of multiple languages including Tagalog, Spanish, Russian, and Mandarin
From an LLMOps perspective, one of the most impressive aspects was the speed of implementation - achieving a production-ready system in just two weeks. This rapid deployment was enabled by several factors:

• Well-documented example repositories and workflows
• Structured training and fine-tuning process
• Efficient infrastructure management tools
• Streamlined deployment pipeline
The case study also highlights important considerations for production LLM deployments:

• Model Selection Trade-offs: They chose a smaller 7B parameter model specifically to meet latency requirements and hardware constraints, showing the importance of practical deployment considerations over raw model size.
• Infrastructure Optimization: The ability to run on a single A10 GPU was a key requirement, demonstrating how hardware constraints often drive architectural decisions in production systems.
• Monitoring and Observability: Integration with tools like Weights & Biases shows the importance of maintaining visibility into model training and performance.
• Standardization: Using common formats (Hugging Face) and tools made the system more maintainable and interoperable.
The successful implementation has opened up new possibilities for Vannevar Labs, enabling them to:

• Process larger volumes of data more efficiently
• Handle multiple languages effectively
• Maintain lower operational costs
• Scale their AI-driven insights across different defense missions
From an LLMOps perspective, this case study demonstrates the importance of having a well-structured approach to model development and deployment, with careful consideration of infrastructure, monitoring, and optimization requirements. The success of moving from a commercial API to a custom-trained model shows how organizations can effectively balance development speed, cost, and performance when implementing LLMs in production environments.

The rapid deployment timeline (2 weeks) is particularly noteworthy and suggests that with the right tools and infrastructure, organizations can quickly transition from commercial API dependencies to custom-trained models when needed. However, it's important to note that this speed was likely enabled by having clear requirements, appropriate tooling, and existing expertise in the team.

## Short Summary

Harvey, a legal AI company, has developed a comprehensive approach to building and evaluating AI systems for legal professionals, addressing the unique challenges of document complexity, nuanced outputs, and high-stakes accuracy requirements. Their solution combines human-in-the-loop evaluation with automated model-based assessments, custom benchmarks like BigLawBench, and a ""lawyer-in-the-loop"" product development philosophy that embeds legal domain experts throughout the engineering process. The company has achieved significant scale with nearly 400 customers globally, including one-third of the largest 100 US law firms, demonstrating measurable improvements in evaluation quality and product iteration speed through their systematic LLMOps approach.

## Long Summary

## Company Overview and Use Case

Harvey is a legal AI company that provides a comprehensive suite of AI-powered tools specifically designed for legal professionals and law firms. The company offers multiple product categories including general-purpose assistants for document drafting and summarization, large-scale document extraction tools, and domain-specific agents and workflows. Harvey's vision centers on two key objectives: enabling legal professionals to perform all their work within the Harvey platform, and making Harvey available wherever legal work occurs.

The company has achieved considerable market penetration, serving just under 400 customers across all continents (except Antarctica), with particularly strong adoption among large US law firms where one-third of the largest 100 firms and eight out of the top 10 largest firms use Harvey. This scale of deployment represents a significant real-world validation of their LLMOps approach in a highly regulated and risk-sensitive industry.

## Technical Challenges and Domain Complexity

The legal domain presents unique challenges that make it particularly demanding for LLMOps implementation. Legal professionals work with extremely complex documents that can span hundreds or thousands of pages, often existing within large corpora of interconnected case law, legislation, and case-related materials. These documents frequently contain extensive cross-references and exhibit significant structural complexity including handwriting, scanned notes, multi-column layouts, embedded tables, and multiple mini-pages within single documents.

The outputs required by legal professionals are equally complex, ranging from long-form text and intricate tables to diagrams and charts for reports, all requiring the sophisticated legal language that professionals expect. The stakes are exceptionally high, as mistakes can have career-impacting consequences, making verification and accuracy paramount. This goes beyond simple hallucination detection to include the more nuanced challenge of identifying slightly misconstrued or misinterpreted statements that may be factually incorrect in context.

Quality assessment in the legal domain is inherently subjective and nuanced. Harvey's presentation included an example where two responses to the same document understanding question about materiality scrape and indemnification were both factually correct and free of hallucinations, yet one was strongly preferred by in-house lawyers due to additional nuance and detailed definitions. This illustrates the difficulty of automatically assessing quality and the critical importance of human judgment in evaluation processes.

## Product Development Philosophy and LLMOps Integration

Harvey has developed a distinctive product development approach that tightly integrates evaluation into the development process. Their philosophy rests on three core principles that directly impact their LLMOps implementation:

Applied Company Focus: Harvey emphasizes that success requires combining state-of-the-art AI with best-in-class user interfaces. This principle recognizes that having the best AI technology alone is insufficient; the AI must be packaged and delivered in ways that meet customers where they are and help solve real-world problems.

Lawyer-in-the-Loop: This principle represents perhaps the most significant aspect of Harvey's LLMOps approach. The company embeds lawyers at every stage of the product development process, recognizing that the incredible complexity and nuance in legal work requires domain expertise and user empathy. Lawyers work side-by-side with engineers, designers, and product managers on all aspects of product development, from identifying use cases and data set collection to evaluation rubric creation, UI iteration, and end-to-end testing. This integration extends to go-to-market activities, where lawyers participate in customer demos, collect feedback, and translate customer needs back to product development teams.

Prototype Over PRD: Rather than relying heavily on product requirement documents or specifications, Harvey believes that building great products happens through frequent prototyping and iteration. They have invested significantly in building their own AI prototyping stack to enable rapid iteration on prompts, algorithms, and user interfaces.

## Evaluation Framework and Methodologies

Harvey's evaluation approach encompasses three primary methodologies, each addressing different aspects of their LLMOps needs:

Human Preference Judgments: Despite advances in automated evaluation, human preference judgments remain Harvey's highest quality signal. The company has invested heavily in improving the throughput and streamlining operations to collect this data efficiently, enabling them to run more evaluations more quickly at lower cost. Their classic side-by-side evaluation tool presents human raters with standardized query datasets representing common customer questions, asking them to evaluate two responses to the same query. Raters provide both relative preferences and absolute ratings on scales (typically 1-7), along with qualitative feedback.

Model-Based Auto Evaluations: Harvey implements LLM-as-a-judge systems to approximate the quality of human review, though they acknowledge the significant challenges this presents in real-world complexity. They developed their own evaluation benchmark called BigLawBench, which contains complex open-ended tasks with subjective answers that more closely mirror real-world legal work, in contrast to academic benchmarks like LegalBench that focus on simple yes/no questions.

Component-Based Evaluation: For complex multi-step workflows and agents, Harvey breaks problems down into evaluable components. Using RAG as an example, they separately evaluate query rewriting, chunk retrieval and matching, answer generation from sources, and citation creation. This decomposition makes automated evaluation more tractable and enables more targeted improvements.

## Custom Benchmarking and Evaluation Tooling

Harvey's development of BigLawBench represents a significant contribution to legal AI evaluation. Unlike academic benchmarks that typically feature simple questions with straightforward answers, BigLawBench includes complex open-ended tasks requiring subjective judgment that reflect actual legal work. For example, instead of asking simple yes/no questions about hearsay, BigLawBench might ask users to ""analyze these trial documents and draft an analysis of conflicts, gaps, contradictions,"" expecting paragraphs of nuanced text as output.

To enable automated evaluation of such complex outputs, Harvey has developed sophisticated rubric systems that break evaluation into multiple categories:

• Structure: Assessing whether responses are formatted correctly (e.g., as tables with specific columns)
• Style: Evaluating whether responses emphasize actionable advice or meet other stylistic requirements
• Substance: Checking whether responses accurately reference and incorporate facts from relevant documents
• Accuracy: Identifying hallucinations or misconstrued information
Each evaluation criterion is crafted by Harvey's in-house domain experts and is distinct for each question-answer pair, representing significant investment in evaluation infrastructure.

## Production Deployment and Model Integration

Harvey's approach to model deployment is illustrated through their integration of GPT-4.1 in April. Their systematic evaluation process demonstrates mature LLMOps practices:

Initial Assessment: They first ran BigLawBench to get a rough quality assessment, finding that GPT-4.1 performed better than other foundation models within Harvey's AI systems.

Human Evaluation: They conducted extensive human rater evaluations, comparing their baseline system with the new GPT-4.1-based system using their established 1-7 rating scale. Results showed the new system skewing significantly toward higher quality ratings.

Additional Testing: Beyond initial positive results, they ran extensive additional tests on product-specific datasets to understand performance characteristics and identify potential shortcomings.

Internal Validation: They conducted internal dogfooding to collect qualitative feedback from in-house teams, which helped identify regressions such as GPT-4.1's tendency to start responses with ""Certainly!"" which was off-brand and inappropriate for legal contexts.

## Tooling and Infrastructure

Harvey has made significant investments in evaluation tooling and infrastructure. They leverage LangSmith extensively for routine evaluations, particularly those involving task decomposition, while building custom tools for human-rater-focused evaluations. This mixed approach allows them to optimize different evaluation workflows appropriately.

Their investment in tooling has paid dividends, with improvements in evaluation capabilities leading to increased adoption across teams, more frequent evaluation usage, improved iteration speed, enhanced product quality, and greater confidence in product quality that enables faster customer deployment.

## Technical Architecture and Workflow Examples

Harvey's technical approach is exemplified in their workflow development process. When building a new workflow (such as drafting client alerts), their process involves:

Domain Expert Input: Lawyers provide initial context about the document type, its typical use cases, and when it appears in daily legal work.

Collaborative Development: Lawyers collaborate with engineers and product teams to build algorithms and evaluation datasets.

Iterative Prototyping: Engineers build prototypes that undergo multiple iterations based on output evaluation and expert feedback.

Product Integration: Parallel development of production-ready features embedded in the main product with UI iteration capabilities.

This approach has enabled Harvey to build dozens of workflows efficiently while maintaining high quality standards.

## Multi-Modal Document Processing

Harvey's system handles the significant complexity of legal document processing, including documents with handwriting, scanned notes, multi-column layouts, embedded tables, and various other formatting challenges. Their large-scale document analysis tools can process hundreds or thousands of documents simultaneously, outputting results to tables or summaries, which saves hours or weeks of manual work typically required for due diligence or legal discovery tasks.

## Agent Capabilities and Future Direction

Harvey has incorporated agentic capabilities including multi-step agentic search, enhanced personalization and memory, and the ability to execute long-running tasks. The company indicated significant additional agent capabilities in development.

Looking forward, Harvey identifies process data as crucial for advancing domain-specific agentic workflows. They argue that while AI progress has historically relied on increasing amounts of publicly available data for larger models, building real-world agentic systems requires process data showing how work gets done within organizations. Using M&A transactions as an example, they note that such work spans months or years, involves hundreds of subtasks, and often lacks written playbooks, with critical knowledge captured in informal conversations or handwritten notes. Extracting and applying this process data represents what they see as the next breakthrough opportunity for agentic systems.

## Key Learnings and Best Practices

Harvey's experience has yielded several important insights for LLMOps practitioners:

Engineering Focus: They emphasize that evaluation is fundamentally an engineering problem, and investment in strong tooling, processes, and documentation pays back significantly. Their 10x improvement in evaluation capabilities demonstrates the value of this approach.

Balance of Rigor and Judgment: While rigorous and repeatable evaluations are critical for product progress, human judgment, qualitative feedback, and taste remain equally important. Harvey continuously makes improvements based on qualitative feedback that don't necessarily impact evaluation metrics but clearly improve the product through enhanced speed, consistency, or usability.

Tool Selection Flexibility: Their mixed approach using both LangSmith and custom-built tools demonstrates the value of evaluating different solutions and selecting appropriate tools for specific use cases rather than adopting a one-size-fits-all approach.

The case study represents a mature example of LLMOps implementation in a domain with extreme quality requirements, demonstrating how systematic evaluation approaches, domain expert integration, and significant tooling investment can enable successful production AI deployment at scale in highly regulated environments.
